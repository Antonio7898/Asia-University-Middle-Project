       "['Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake consistently lags behind that of other adolescent vaccines. In 2017, uptake of a single HPV vaccine dose and HPV vaccine series completion was 66% and 49%, respectively, compared to uptake of tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (89%) and quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (85%). Reasons for not vaccinating adolescents again HPV are varied, and in many cases, are rooted in commonly spread myths and misperceptions about the vaccine. In this review, we address five key myths - HPV vaccination is not effective at preventing cancer; Pap smears are sufficient to prevent cervical cancer; HPV vaccination is not safe; HPV vaccination is not needed since most infections are naturally cleared by the immune system; 11-12\\xa0years of age is too young to vaccinate. For each myth, we summarize the scientific evidence refuting the myth and provide speaking prompts for healthcare professionals to communicate about HPV vaccination.',\n",
       " 'This brief review discusses some recent advances in vaccine technologies with particular reference to their application within veterinary medicine. It highlights some of the key inactivated/killed approaches to vaccination, including natural split-product and subunit vaccines, recombinant subunit and protein vaccines, and peptide vaccines. It also covers live/attenuated vaccine strategies, including modified live marker/differentiating infected from vaccinated animals vaccines, live vector vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines.',\n",
       " 'PURPOSE: Vaccines represent one of the most important aspects of pediatric preventive care. However, parents are increasingly questioning the safety of and need for vaccines, and as a result, vaccination rates have fallen to dangerously low levels in certain communities. The effects of vaccine hesitancy are widespread. Community pediatricians who interact regularly with vaccine-hesitant parents report higher levels of burnout and lower levels of job satisfaction. Not surprisingly, vaccine hesitancy has also had direct influence on vaccination rates, which in turn are linked to increased emergency department use, morbidity, and mortality. METHODS: Literature from 1999 to 2017 regarding vaccines and vaccine hesitancy was reviewed. FINDINGS: Few evidence-based strategies exist to guide providers in their discussions with vaccines-hesitant parents. Recent research has shown a presumptive approach (ie, the provider uses language that presumes the caregiver will vaccinate his or her child) is associated with higher vaccination uptake. Motivational interviewing is a promising technique for more hesitant parents. IMPLICATIONS: At the community level, evidence-based communication strategies to address vaccine hesitancy are needed. The practice of dismissing families from pediatric practices who refuse to vaccinate is common, although widely criticized. Other controversial and rapidly evolving topics include statewide vaccination mandates and school exemption policies. Electronic interventions, such as text-messaging services and social media, have recently emerged as effective methods of communication and may become more important in coming years.',\n",
       " 'Parental refusal or delay of childhood vaccines is increasing. Barriers to vaccination among this population have been described, yet less is known regarding motivating factors. Researchers are beginning to evaluate various approaches to address the concerns of \"vaccine-hesitant\" parents, but few studies have evaluated the effect of interventions on timely vaccine uptake. Several models for communicating with vaccine-hesitant parents have been reported for healthcare providers; however, the effectiveness and utility of these strategies has not been quantified. This article reviews the known barriers to vaccination reported by vaccine-hesitant parents and the current evidence on strategies to address parental vaccine hesitancy.',\n",
       " \"While most people vaccinate according to the recommended schedule, this success is challenged by individuals and groups who delay or refuse vaccines. The aim of this article is to review studies on vaccine hesitancy among healthcare providers (HCPs), and the influences of their own vaccine confidence and vaccination behaviour on their vaccination recommendations to others. The search strategy was developed in Medline and then adapted across several multidisciplinary mainstream databases including Embase Classic & Embase, and PschInfo. All foreign language articles were included if the abstract was available in English. A total of 185 articles were included in the literature review. 66% studied the vaccine hesitancy among HCPs, 17% analysed concerns, attitudes and/or behaviour of HCPs towards vaccinating others, and 9% were about evaluating intervention(s). Overall, knowledge about particular vaccines, their efficacy and safety, helped to build HCPs own confidence in vaccines and their willingness to recommend vaccines to others. The importance of societal endorsement and support from colleagues was also reported. In the face of emerging vaccine hesitancy, HCPs still remain the most trusted advisor and influencer of vaccination decisions. The capacity and confidence of HCPs, though, are stretched as they are faced with time constraints, increased workload and limited resources, and often have inadequate information or training support to address parents' questions. Overall, HCPs need more support to manage the quickly evolving vaccine environment as well as changing public, especially those who are reluctant or refuse vaccination. Some recommended strategies included strengthening trust between HCPs, health authorities and policymakers, through more shared involvement in the establishment of vaccine recommendations.\",\n",
       " 'Despite being recognized as one of the most successful public health measures, vaccination is perceived as unsafe and unnecessary by a growing number of individuals. Lack of confidence in vaccines is now considered a threat to the success of vaccination programs. Vaccine hesitancy is believed to be responsible for decreasing vaccine coverage and an increasing risk of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks and epidemics. This review provides an overview of the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy. First, we will characterize vaccine hesitancy and suggest the possible causes of the apparent increase in vaccine hesitancy in the developed world. Then we will look at determinants of individual decision-making about vaccination.',\n",

       " \"BACKGROUND: Many parents make a conscious decision not to vaccinate their child. Multiple beliefs and perceptions surround this choice. If uptake of routine child vaccination is to increase, public health communications about vaccines must be informed by evidence on the factors affecting uptake. METHOD: We conducted a systematic review to investigate psychological, social and contextual factors associated with uptake of routine vaccines in young children. Studies were included if they reported analyses of the association between psychological factors and uptake or included parents' self-reported reasons for or against vaccination. RESULTS: Our search identified 9110 citations after deduplication. Sixty-eight citations describing sixty-four studies were included in the review. The quality of the studies was mixed. There is strong evidence for an association between vaccination uptake and: not perceiving vaccines to cause adverse effects; general positive attitudes towards vaccination; positive vaccine recommendations; and perceiving fewer practical difficulties of vaccination. While there was good evidence for an association between vaccination and perceived susceptibility to the illness, evidence for an association between perceived severity of an illness and vaccination was weak. Other factors associated with vaccination include knowledge about the vaccine, social influences and trust in the healthcare profession. Having increased information about the vaccine was associated with vaccination, but the influence of different sources of information needs more research. CONCLUSION: Understanding which factors are consistently associated with the decision to vaccinate one's child is important to identify messages which should be targeted by public health communications about routine child vaccinations.\",\n",
       " \"Despite vaccination's role in preventing communicable diseases, misinformation threatens uptake. Social media may disseminate such anti-vaccination messages. We characterized trends in pro- and anti-vaccination discourse on Twitter. All tweets between 2010 and 2019 containing vaccine-related hashtags were identified. Pro- and anti-vaccine tweets and users per quarter (3-months) were tabulated; discussion subcommunities were identified with network analysis. 1,637,712 vaccine-related tweets were identified from 154 pro-vaccine and 125 anti-vaccine hashtags, with 86% of users posting exclusively pro-vaccine and 12% posting exclusively anti-vaccine hashtags. Pro-vaccine tweet volumes are larger than anti-vaccine tweets and consistently increase over time. In contrast, anti-vaccine tweet volumes have decreased since 2014, despite an increasing anti-vaccine user-base. Users infrequently responded across pro/anti-vaccine alignment (0.2%). Despite greater volumes of pro-vaccination discourse in recent years, and the anti-vaccination content userbase being smaller, the anti-vaccine community continues to grow in size. This finding coupled with the minimal inter-communication between communities suggests possible ideological isolation.\",\n",
       " 'The current studies investigated the potential impact of anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs, and exposure to anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, on vaccination intentions. In Study 1, British parents completed a questionnaire measuring beliefs in anti-vaccine conspiracy theories and the likelihood that they would have a fictitious child vaccinated. Results revealed a significant negative relationship between anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs and vaccination intentions. This effect was mediated by the perceived dangers of vaccines, and feelings of powerlessness, disillusionment and mistrust in authorities. In Study 2, participants were exposed to information that either supported or refuted anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, or a control condition. Results revealed that participants who had been exposed to material supporting anti-vaccine conspiracy theories showed less intention to vaccinate than those in the anti-conspiracy condition or controls. This effect was mediated by the same variables as in Study 1. These findings point to the potentially detrimental consequences of anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, and highlight their potential role in shaping health-related behaviors.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Vaccination constitutes a major advance in the prevention of infectious diseases. The principle of vaccination is to induce protection against a pathogen by mimicking its natural interaction with the human immune system. The vaccine reduces the risk of complications and mortality following subsequent exposure to an infectious agent. STATE OF THE ART: In this review we recall the history of vaccination as well as the basic immunological principles underlying the composition of vaccines and the response to vaccination. In this way, vaccines induce the immune system to produce an immunological memory based on T and B lymphocytes in order to produce a rapid and effective response to exposure to the targeted pathogen. OUTLOOK: The improvement of existing vaccines and the discovery of new vaccines requires an understanding of the immunological principles of vaccination. Great challenges remain, particularly in terms of target pathogens for future vaccine candidates and also the acceptance of vaccination. CONCLUSION: Understanding the principles of vaccination allows development of vaccines and the control of infectious diseases.',\n",
       " 'Vaccination is amongst the best strategies to improve child survival and reduce morbidity. Vaccines represent the most cost effective and simple intervention to protect against distressing epidemics. There are mortality and morbidity related benefits derived from preventing infectious diseases through vaccination; these include financial benefits by avoiding hospitalization, preventing long-term disability and increased productivity. Ever since the invention of the first vaccine against smallpox by Edward Jenner in 1796, vaccination has become indispensable healthcare intervention and has saved millions of lives. Due to significant scientific progress, many vaccines are available and numerous are anticipated; however, vaccine preventable infectious diseases are still prevalent. Due to rapid pace of developments in the field of vaccination, providers must continue to update their knowledge. The present review is aimed at helping general practitioners understand routine vaccinations, their considerations, issues and side effects.',\n",

       " 'Studies to better understand the determinants of vaccine acceptance have expanded to include more investigation into dynamics of individual decision-making as well as the influences of peers and social networks. Vaccine acceptance is determined by a range of factors, from structural issues of supply, costs and access to services, as well as the more demand-side determinants. The term vaccine hesitancy is increasingly used in the investigation of demand-side determinants, moving away from the more polarized framing of pro- and anti-vaccine groups to recognizing the importance of understanding and engaging those who are delaying vaccination, accepting only some vaccines, or who are yet undecided, but reluctant. As hesitancy is a state of indecision, it is difficult to measure, but the stage of indecision is a critical time to engage and support the decision-making process. This article suggests modes of investigating the determinants of vaccine confidence and levers of vaccine acceptance toward better engagement and dialogue early in the process of decision-making. Pressure to vaccinate can be counter-productive. Listening and dialog can support individual decision-making and more effectively inform the public health community of the issues and concerns influencing vaccine hesitancy.',\n",
       " 'Vaccine-preventable diseases are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. As new vaccines are proving to be effective and as the incidence of some infections decreases, vaccination practices are changing. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are particularly exposed to and play a role in nosocomial transmission, which makes them an important target group for vaccination. Most vaccine-preventable diseases still carry a significant risk of resurgence and have caused outbreaks in recent years. While many professional societies favor vaccination of HCWs as well as the general population, recommendations differ from country to country. In turn, vaccination coverage varies widely for each microorganism and for each country, making hospitals and clinics vulnerable to outbreaks. Vaccine mandates and non-mandatory strategies are the subject of ongoing research and controversies. Optimal approaches to increase coverage and turn the healthcare workforce into an efficient barrier against infectious diseases are still being debated.',\n",
       " 'During the second half of the 20th century, vaccinations led to the control or even eradication of several vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) in Europe. However, outbreaks of VPDs continue to occur even in countries with well-established vaccination programs. Reasons include the existence of under-vaccinated populations, the increasing anti-vaccination movement and the increasing movement of populations across borders. Ensuring adequate levels of herd immunity is the only reliable method for preventing epidemics and a re-emergence of VPDs. In order to achieve this, more flexible vaccine delivery platforms are needed targeting the less-privileged people, especially in the context of the current economic crisis. Healthcare personnel and healthcare systems should be prepared to address these challenges in the following years.',\n",

However, in France, there is an emergence of vaccine hesitancy, that has caused a reduction of vaccination coverage rates. This issue reduces the effectiveness of the immunization process, and represents a real threat to public health that should be urgently addressed. The purpose of this review is to present actions that have been taken to fight against vaccine hesitancy and thus enhance vaccine uptake. The results indicate that different strategies have been proposed to reach this goal, mainly by vaccination campaigns. These findings highlight the strong implication of national health authorities and the medical staff of hospitals and health-care centers. However, actions implemented should be part of a long-term approach, and further studies are required to identify the most effective strategies to address vaccine hesitancy.',\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: Vaccinations are an effective choice to stop disease outbreaks, including COVID-19. There is little research on individuals' COVID-19 vaccination decision-making. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine individual preferences for COVID-19 vaccinations in China, and to assess the factors influencing vaccination decision-making to facilitate vaccination coverage. METHODS: A D-efficient discrete choice experiment was conducted across six Chinese provinces selected by the stratified random sampling method. Vaccine choice sets were constructed using seven attributes: vaccine effectiveness, side-effects, accessibility, number of doses, vaccination sites, duration of vaccine protection, and proportion of acquaintances vaccinated. Conditional logit and latent class models were used to identify preferences. RESULTS: Although all seven attributes were proved to significantly influence respondents' vaccination decision, vaccine effectiveness, side-effects and proportion of acquaintances vaccinated were the most important. We also found a higher probability of vaccinating when the vaccine was more effective; risks of serious side effects were small; vaccinations were free and voluntary; the fewer the number of doses; the longer the protection duration; and the higher the proportion of acquaintances vaccinated. Higher local vaccine coverage created altruistic herd incentives to vaccinate rather than free-rider problems. The predicted vaccination uptake of the optimal vaccination scenario in our study was 84.77%. Preference heterogeneity was substantial. Individuals who were older, had a lower education level, lower income, higher trust in the vaccine and higher perceived risk of infection, displayed a higher probability to vaccinate. CONCLUSIONS: Preference heterogeneity among individuals should lead health authorities to address the diversity of expectations about COVID-19 vaccinations. To maximize COVID-19 vaccine uptake, health authorities should promote vaccine effectiveness; pro-actively communicate the absence or presence of vaccine side effects; and ensure rapid and wide media communication about local vaccine coverage.\",\n",
       " 'The need for minimally invasive delivery methods is urgent. As the number of registered vaccines increases, so does the number of injections. The use of sharps can be unsafe and needle immunisation is less suitable for mass immunisations during emergencies such as pandemics or bioterrorist attacks. The approach of combining vaccines has limitations due to high development costs, risk of pharmaceutical or immunological interference and economic risks. Advancements in the development of alternatives to injection with syringes and needles are discussed in this paper, and include: mucosal vaccination, injection without needles and vaccine delivery via the skin.',\n",
       " \"Vaccines have prevented and nearly eliminated several deadly diseases, yet they face skepticism from the public. One potential driver of vaccine skepticism is how people process event frequencies such as rare adverse reactions to vaccines. Misestimations may distort the perceived risks of vaccinating. The current study examined how vaccine skepticism is related to accuracy in event frequency processing. In Experiment 1, participants (n\\xa0=\\xa0158) estimated the frequencies of several vital statistics (e.g., 'How many people die per year in the U.S. from emphysema?'). Higher levels of vaccine skepticism were associated with lower accuracy in frequency estimation and over-estimation of rare events. In Experiment 2 (n\\xa0=\\xa0109), we again found that vaccine skepticism was negatively associated with vital statistic estimation accuracy but not for emotionally neutral or positive events. These results suggest that vaccine skepticism may arise from basic individual differences in processing events associated with mortality or negative affect.\",\n",
       " 'Vaccination practices in Germany are driven by scientific developments and a complex regulatory environment. Some important developments in 2018 are described here: Starting in 2018 only quadrivalent influenza vaccines will be used for the seasonal vaccination. Despite the availability of meningococcus ACWY and B vaccines and their use in other countries only the type C conjugate vaccine will be used for the routine vaccination of children. For the first time there is now an official recommendation to also vaccinate boys against HPV using either the bivalent or the nonavalent vaccine. After promising trial results a timely guideline for the use of the newly available adjuvanted subunit zoster vaccine is to be expected. Negative trial results mark a major setback for the development of a CMV vaccine.

       " 'Vaccinations are recommended throughout life to reduce the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases and their sequelae. Vaccines are often administered in patients with chronic diseases who are likely to be treated with several drugs. A growing number of clinical observations have indicated the possibility of interactions between vaccines and drugs, leading to changes in drug metabolism after vaccination. These interactions represent a significant concern because of the increasing use of vaccines in older patients who are likely to be treated with several drugs. Because of the possible implications of adverse reactions in terms of public health, several studies were performed to verify the risk posed by these interactions and to clarify the biologic mechanisms that drive these events. Of the several mechanisms proposed to be at the basis of vaccine-drug interactions, the most convincing evidence suggests a role of inflammatory cytokines on the regulation of specific cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. Differences in the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of these drugs could explain these contrasting results and provide important insights to fully understand the clinical importance of these events. Further studies are required to verify whether vaccine-drug interactions may occur in other clinical settings, especially the ones for which patients are required to be vaccinated against specific diseases.',\n",

       " \"Vaccinations help prevent communicable disease. To be valuable, a vaccine's ability to prevent disease must exceed the risk of adverse effects from administration. Many vaccines present no risk of infection as they are comprised of killed or non-infectious components while other vaccines consist of live attenuated microorganisms which carry a potential risk of infection-particularly, in patients with compromised immunity. There are several unique considerations with respect to vaccination in the multiple sclerosis (MS) population. First, there has been concern that vaccination may trigger or aggravate the disease. Second, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) employed in the treatment of MS may increase the risk of infectious complications from vaccines or alter their efficacy. Lastly, in some cases, vaccination strategies may be part of the treatment paradigm in attempts to avoid complications of therapy.\",\n",
       " \"In this editorial we address the controversies surrounding human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine school-entry mandate legislation, but differentiate between the mandate debate and issues specific to the vaccine itself. Our goal is not to take a stand in favor of or opposed to mandates, but rather to critically examine the issues. We discuss the following arguments against HPV vaccine school-entry requirements: 1. The public health benefit of mandated HPV vaccination is not sufficient to warrant the intrusion on parental autonomy; 2. A vaccine that prevents a non-casually transmitted infection should not be mandated; 3. Opt-out provisions are inherently unfair to parents who oppose HPV vaccination; 4. Limited health care dollars should not be directed toward cervical cancer prevention; and 5. The vaccine is expensive and potential problems with supply suggest that mandates should not be implemented until insurance coverage and supply issues are resolved. Next, we critically evaluate the following critiques of HPV vaccination itself: 1. Giving girls HPV vaccine implies tacit consent to engage in sexual activity; 2. Giving girls this vaccine will confer a false sense of protection from sexually transmitted infections and will lead to sexual disinhibition; 3. Children already have too many vaccinations on the immunization schedule; 4. Long-term side effects of HPV vaccine are unknown; 5. The vaccine's enduring effectiveness is unknown and booster shots may be required; and 6. It is wrong to only target girls with HPV vaccine; boys should be vaccinated as well.\",\n",
       " 'While vaccine acceptance remains high in general, fear of vaccines has grown dramatically in the past several years in many developed countries. In some communities, this fear has led to significantly increased rates of vaccine refusal which are associated with increases in illness and death from vaccine-preventable diseases, and large economic costs for health care and society. Despite overwhelming evidence supporting the safety and benefits of vaccination, this fear has proven resistant to information campaigns, a phenomenon well-explained by psychological research which has established that risk perception is subjective, a product of both the facts and how those facts feel. Given the innately emotional and instinctive nature of risk perception, and the risks to public health these perceptions produce, and consistent with well-established legal principles supporting government action to protect the common good, society has the right and responsibility to establish laws, regulations, and choice frameworks that discourage vaccine refusal.',\n",
       " 'Barriers to human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine acceptability in Israel include Israel\\'s relatively low incidence of cervical cancer; the religiously-based 80% circumcision rate in Israel, which is regarded as contributing to the lower incidence of HPV infection in the country; the fact that HPV vaccine provides immunity against only few virus types; the vaccine\\'s high cost; and the perception that HPV transmission is associated with unacceptable sexual relations. A recent survey has demonstrated that, following media two campaigns, Israeli\\'s level of awareness of the vaccine increased but the actual vaccination rate remained low, at approximately 10%. Survey findings also indicated that an enduring barrier to HPV vaccination is the vaccine\\'s high cost. Recent research on a convenience sample of Israeli undergraduate women 21 to 24 years of age showed that intentions to receive HPV vaccination in the coming year were a function of women\\'s attitudes towards getting vaccinated and their perceptions of social support for doing so. Undergraduate women who intended to be vaccinated perceived the prevention of cervical cancer, avoidance of personal health threat, and avoidance of HPV infection per se to be the advantages of undergoing HPV vaccination. Disadvantages of getting vaccinated included fear of vaccine side effects, cost of the vaccine, and newness of the vaccine, doubts about vaccines, time required to undergo multiple vaccinations, and dislike of injections.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Vaccines are very effective medical tools for disease prevention and life span increase. Controversies have raised concern about their safety, from autism to polio vaccine contamination with simian virus 40 (SV-40). Hysteria surrounding vaccine-associated risks has resulted in a declining number of vaccinations in developed countries. Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g. measles) have occurred in Europe and North America, causing also some causalities. OBJECTIVES: In this review, data on safety and efficacy of vaccines are discussed, showing that the benefits of vaccines far outweigh the risks and that it is important to comply with vaccination protocols, to avoid spreading of severe, preventable diseases. METHODS: Those opposed to vaccinations suggest that scientific literature supporting vaccines is influenced by pharmaceutical companies. In this review, studies on influenza produced by independent scientists and those authored by those who received some kind of benefit from the industry are discussed separately. All the chosen papers were selected through a MEDLINE research. RESULTS: Vaccination rates are decreasing, even though they are effective public health tools. Influenza, for example, is responsible for 250,000-500,000 deaths each year, according to the WHO. Yet, campaigns to extend influenza vaccine to all elderly subjects report little success, because of the vaccine scare and because not all patients develop immunity following vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: This review proves that vaccine hysteria is detrimental because: 1) it causes an increased morbidity and mortality from preventable diseases; 2) it jeopardizes research for new vaccines; 3) patients are reluctant to accept any form of immune-therapy, commonly referred to as \"vaccination\".',\n",

Infections in these patients can have drastic consequences for disease morbidity and mortality. Immunization is a crucial preventive strategy for disease management in this pediatric population. However, vaccination coverage among children with CKD remains low due to safety concerns and doubts about vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. In this study, we reviewed why children with CKD are at higher risk of infections, the importance of vaccinations among these children, barriers to vaccinations, and recommend the best vaccination schedules. Overall, vaccines have acceptable immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety profiles in children with CKD. However, in some cases, the protective antibody levels induced by vaccines and the benefits and risks of booster vaccine doses must be individually managed. Furthermore, close contacts and household members of these children should complete age-appropriate vaccination schedules to increase the child's indirect protection.\",\n",

On the other hand, because vaccine is administrated to healthy people, it has had a difficult history due to overreaction to adverse events. With the recent rapid increase in the rate of vaccination, however, it is essential to correct the understanding of the public as to the risk and benefit of vaccine. Life spans around the world and infectious diseases are closely related, and vaccine certainly contributes to the control of the latter. Research and Development (R&D) of novel antigens is necessary for creating a next generation vaccine, a high performance device for efficient antigen delivery, and a safe adjuvant for adequate immunological response are also a key to the future. Moreover, various initiatives involving industry, academia, and government cooperation are essential to benefit the people of Japan and appropriate vaccination could actually be viewed as national security.',\n",

Despite the effectiveness and availability of vaccines in many parts of the world, vaccination rates and service uptake remains suboptimal among both healthcare providers and the public. Pharmacists as established advocates, educators as well as qualified providers of vaccinations have a significant role to play in promoting and supporting the uptake of vaccination.

Overcoming these barriers will increase the role of pharmacists as vaccinators that ultimately increases public access to vaccination and accurate and reliable information about vaccines.',\n",
       " \"The existing vaccine paradigm assumes that vaccines only protect against the target infection, that effective vaccines reduce mortality corresponding to the target infection's share of total mortality, and that the effects of vaccines are similar for males and females. However, epidemiological vaccine research has generated observations that contradict these assumptions and suggest that vaccines have important non-specific effects on overall health in populations. These include the observations that several live vaccines reduce the incidence of all-cause mortality in vaccinated compared with unvaccinated populations far more than can be explained by protection against the target infections, and that several non-live vaccines are associated with increased all-cause mortality in females. In this Personal View we describe current observations and contradictions and define six emerging principles that might explain them. First, that live vaccines enhance resistance towards unrelated infections. Second, non-live vaccines enhance the susceptibility of girls to unrelated infections. Third, the most recently administered vaccination has the strongest non-specific effects. Fourth, combinations of live and non-live vaccines given together have variable non-specific health effects. Fifth, vaccinating children with live vaccines in the presence of maternal immunity enhances beneficial non-specific effects and reduces mortality. Finally, vaccines might interact with other co-administered health interventions, for example vitamin A supplementation. The potential implications for child health are substantial. For example, if BCG vaccination was given to children at birth, if higher measles vaccination coverage could be obtained, if diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis-containing vaccines were not given with or after measles vaccine, or if the BCG strain with the best non-specific effects could be used consistently, then child mortality could be considerably lower. Pursuing these emerging principles could improve our understanding and use of vaccines globally.\",\n",

Hence, this review targets five topics concerning vaccines and reviews current scientific publications in order to summarize the available information refuting conspiracy theories and myths about vaccination. The topics have been selected based on the author's personal perception of the most frequently occurring safety controversies: the inactivation agent formaldehyde, the adjuvant aluminum, the preservative mercury, the mistakenly-drawn correlation between vaccines and autism and genetic vaccines. The scientific literature shows that vaccine safety is constantly studied. Furthermore, the literature does not support the allegations that vaccines may cause a serious threat to general human life. The author suggests that more researchers explaining their research ideas, methods and results publicly could strengthen the general confidence in science. In general, vaccines present one of the safest and most cost-effective medications and none of the targeted topics raised serious health concerns.\",\n",

       " 'OBJECTIVES: The success of vaccination strategies depends in part on population perceptions of benefits and risks of vaccines and related confidence in vaccination. Better knowledge of public concerns about vaccines and what is driving them is needed to inform vaccination strategies and communications. This literature reviewer examined studies on vaccine and vaccination risk perceptions and concerns across European populations. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies published between 2004 and 2014 in Europe. A descriptive analysis was performed. FINDINGS: A total of 145 articles were selected, most of which were conducted in the UK, the Netherlands and France and studied seasonal influenza, HPV and pandemic influenza vaccination. Across all countries and vaccines, the primary area of concern was vaccine safety, followed by perceptions of low likelihood of contracting vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), perceived low severity of VPDs, beliefs that vaccines do not work, and overall lack of information. Concerns were found to be vaccine-, country- and population-specific. CONCLUSION: In addition to identifying concerns about vaccination in Europe, this study confirmed the notion that individuals have many safety concerns about vaccination and often believe that the risks of vaccination outweigh their benefits. More research needs to be conducted to explore the impact of different types of communication strategies, which would frame the benefits of vaccination as well as risks of not vaccinating. Strategies to better inform public perceptions of vaccines should include the provision of unbiased, comprehensive information tailored to population information needs, and delivered using multiple and new communication technologies such as social media.',\n",

       " 'Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating disease of the central nervous systems (CNS). Disease-modifying treatments (including immunosuppressive treatments) have shown positive effects on the disease course, but are associated with systemic consequences on the immune system and may increase the risk of infections and alter vaccine efficiency. Therefore, vaccination of MS patients is of major interest. Over the last years, vaccine hesitancy has steadily grown especially in Western countries, partly due to fear of sequelae arising from vaccination, especially neurological disorders. The interaction of vaccination and MS has been discussed for decades. In this review, we highlight the immunology of vaccination, provide a review of literature and discuss the clinical consideration of MS, vaccination and immunosuppression. In conclusion, there is consensus that MS cannot be caused by vaccines, neither by inactivated nor by live vaccines. However, particular attention should be paid to two aspects: First, in immunocompromised patients, live vaccines may lead to a stronger immune reaction with signs of the disease against which the patients have been vaccinated, albeit in weakened form. Second, protection provided by vaccination should be controlled in patients who have been vaccinated while receiving immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatment. In conclusion, there is evidence that systemic infections can worsen MS, thus vaccination will lower the risk of relapses by reducing the risk of infections. Therefore, vaccination should be in general recommended to MS patients.',\n",
       " 'Vaccines save millions of lives every year. They are one of the safest and most effective public health interventions in keeping populations healthy while bringing numerous social and economic benefits. Vaccines play an important role in ensuring that children, regardless of where they live, can have a healthy start to life. New financing mechanisms that allow poorer countries to gain access to vaccines faster than ever mean additional deaths and disabilities are projected to be saved during the Decade of Vaccines (2011-2020). Trust in vaccines and in the health system is an important element of public health programs that aim to deliver life-saving vaccines. Indeed, understanding the contributors and threats to trust is essential to explaining vaccine acceptance, particularly as they vary across epidemiologic conditions, specific vaccines and cultural and sociopolitical settings. Greater efforts to communicate the benefits and risks of vaccines and address issues with evidence-based information will help improve and sustain public trust in vaccines and health systems worldwide. Measuring and monitoring trust levels and focusing on deliberate efforts to build trust in vaccines are important steps to reducing vaccine confidence gaps when they occur.',\n",
       " 'An often-stated public health comment is that \"vaccination is a victim of its own success.\" While the scientific and medical consensus on the benefits of vaccination is clear and unambiguous, an increasing number of people are perceiving vaccines as unsafe and unnecessary. The World Health Organization identified \"the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite availability of vaccines\" as one of the 10 threats to global health in 2019. The negative influence of anti-vaccination movements is often named as a cause of increasing vaccine resistance in the public. In this review, we give an overview of the current literature on the topic, beginning by agreeing on terminology and concepts before looking at potential causes, consequences, and impacts of resistance to vaccination.',\n",
       " 'The immune system of the elderly is particularly susceptible to infectious diseases and displays reduced response to vaccination. The current vaccines, designed for young and adult individuals, proved less effective and less protective in old people. The world population is rapidly ageing, and consequently preventing infectious diseases in the elderly have become an important public health issue. To this end, it is necessary to develop novel vaccines especially suited to raising protective immunity in the ageing population. Approaches in this direction include high-dose vaccines, booster vaccinations, different immunisation routes, and use of new adjuvants. These approaches, still empirical, must be supported by intensive research to unravel the biological and molecular mechanisms underlying immunosenescence. Only this knowledge would allow us to design approaches to immune rejuvenation and more effective vaccines for protecting the elderly.',\n",

       " 'Recent legislative texts have changed vaccinal policy and reinforced the role of midwives in vaccine prevention in perinatal healthcare. Quite as paediatricians and obstetricians-gynecologists, midwives can now prescribe and carry out, for the mothers, vaccines against rubella, tetanus, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, hepatitis B, influenza and whooping-cough and for the newborns vaccines against hepatitis B and tuberculosis. Concerning vaccinations, practitioners have to respect the vaccination calendar and a collaborative action is useful and necessary. These national guidelines are regularly updated when new vaccines and new recommendations come to light, for example for children (papillomavirus, tuberculosis, pneumococcus...), young adults (varicella, whooping-cough) and health professions in contact with very young children (varicella, measles, influenza and whooping-cough). The recent changes in tuberculosis prevention from routine vaccination of all newborn infants to selective vaccination lead to reinforce measures to detect the infants at higher risk, for them to be vaccinated before discharge at home. Midwives and nurses occupy a central place in family policy and become, with obstetricians-gynecologists and pediatricians, key actors for the effectiveness and the success of vaccine strategies in perinatal health.',\n",
       " 'Research on vaccine criticism on the Internet is now at a crossroads, with an already important body of knowledge published on the subject but also a continuous and even growing interest in the scientific community. In this commentary, we reflect on the published literature from the standpoint of sociologists interested in social movements and their activists and the influence they can have on vaccination behaviors. We suggest several avenues of research for future studies of vaccine criticism on the Internet: 1) paying more attention to the actors who publish vaccine critical contents and to their use of the Internet in relationship to the other means through which they try to mobilize the population - the production of vaccine critical information on the Internet, and not only its nature and its reception, should therefore become one of the main objects of this strand of research -; 2) paying closer attention to what distinguishes the different strands of vaccine criticism regarding both what they dislike about vaccines (or about a given vaccine) and how this fight is integrated in a more general political or cultural struggle; 3) investigating further how the new forms of social interactions allowed by the Internet affect the transmission of vaccine related information and the capacity of vaccine critical actors to enroll members of the public in their political or cultural struggle.',\n",
       " 'PURPOSE: The recommended immunizations for adult asplenic patients are reviewed. SUMMARY: Patients without a spleen are at risk of developing overwhelming postsplenectomy infections due to encapsulated organisms, mainly pneumococcal, meningococcal, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Due to the high mortality rates associated with these infections, vaccinations are recommended as a preventive measure. It is challenging to ensure optimal immunizations in these high-risk patients due to the number of recommended vaccines, the availability of multiple formulations, and the inability to administer specific formulations at the same time, as well as differences in subsequent vaccine administration schedules. Pharmacists play a key role in recommending specific vaccines and timing for these patients in order to achieve the most robust immune response. This article reviews the specific recommendations for pneumococcal, meningococcal, Hib, and influenza vaccinations in asplenic patients. CONCLUSION: In order to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, asplenic individuals should be vaccinated against S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, Hib, and influenza. The optimal timing of vaccination in relation to splenectomy depends on the nature of the splenectomy.',\n",
       " 'Mild local and systemic reactions to vaccines are to be expected as a natural consequence of vigorously stimulating the immune system. Dramatic adverse reactions to vaccines are occasionally due to mistakes during the production or handling of vaccines. More often, they are due to not following label instructions, particularly the restriction to only use vaccines in healthy animals. It is important to publish well-documented instances of adverse vaccine reactions so that producers and users of vaccines can all learn from the experience and avoid similar problems. Vaccine failure to protect from disease is usually due to problems with either client education or compliance with good animal management practices. It is important for clients to understand the proper timing and method of vaccine administration, what to realistically expect for vaccine efficacy, and the importance of minimizing immunosuppressive factors and exposure to high doses of infectious agents in vaccinated animals. Veterinary vaccines have produced dramatic benefits in terms of animal health, human health, and efficiency of food production. Advances in research and the accumulating experience with vaccines are leading to safer and more effective vaccines. Proper usage of vaccines and adherence to good management practices will continue to be essential to achieve maximal vaccine safety and efficacy.',\n",
       " \"A simple dynamic model of vaccination is presented and analyzed to study how the amount of vaccines available affects people's vaccination decisions. In addition, the model is used to examine how the level of vaccination in equilibrium compares to the efficient or socially optimal level. It is shown that, when the stock of vaccines is large so that a shortage could never arise, an equilibrium is generically unique, and there is too little vaccination compared to the social optimum. When the stock of vaccines is small so that not everyone in a population could get vaccinated, a shortage could occur in equilibrium. Moreover, the occurrence of a shortage could be self-fulfilling: when agents expect a shortage to develop, they have a greater incentive to demand the vaccine right away, which increases the likelihood that a shortage will result; and when agents do not expect a shortage to arise, they are more willing to delay their vaccination decision, which reduces the likelihood of a shortage developing. This leads to the possible co-existence of multiple equilibria that differ in the level of vaccination. Multiple equilibria can arise, however, only if agents are uncertain about the cost of being infected - if agents are sufficiently certain about the cost of infection, then an equilibrium is unique. Furthermore, when the stock of vaccines is small, an equilibrium level of vaccination may be too high relative to the socially optimal level. Increasing the vaccine stock could have ambiguous effects on the level of vaccination in equilibrium but unambiguously increases social welfare.\",\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: The level of vaccination coverage with obligatory preparations in Poland reaches 98%. This is facilitated by the introduction of the Individual Vaccination Calendar (IVC) compliant with medical contraindications to vaccination. AIM: The aim of the study was to assess whether the refusal of vaccinations after birth has an impact on the proper implementation of the vaccination calendar in the first year of life. METHODS: The study involved healthy, term newborns who were born in the Department of Neonatology in 2011-2015. There were 156 patients enrolled to the study. Among them, 133 were in the control group - vaccinated after birth, and 23 constituted the study group - not vaccinated after birth. RESULTS: Not all healthy newborns are vaccinated after birth, statistical significance was obtained between the study and control group (p <\\xa00,00001).Only 48% of patients not vaccinated after birth received TB-vaccine during the first year (p <\\xa00,00053).Parents of 26% of infants in the study and of 2% of infants in the control group declared using the IVC (p <\\xa00,001). CONCLUSIONS: Proper implementation of the vaccination schedule in the first year of life results from the initiation of vaccinations after birth.Unreasonable introduction of the IVC promotes incorrect timing of mandatory vaccinations.',\n",
       " 'Japan is well known as a country with a strong health record. However its incidence rates of vaccine preventable diseases (VPD) such as hepatitis B, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella remain higher than other developed countries. This article reviews the factors that contribute to the high rates of VPD in Japan. These include historical and political factors that delayed the introduction of several important vaccines until recently. Access has also been affected by vaccines being divided into government-funded \"routine\" (eg, polio, pertussis) and self-pay \"voluntary\" groups (eg, hepatitis A and B). Routine vaccines have higher rates of administration than voluntary vaccines. Administration factors include differences in well child care schedules, the approach to simultaneous vaccination, vaccination contraindication due to fever, and vaccination spacing. Parental factors include low intention to fully vaccinate their children and misperceptions about side effects and efficacy. There are also provider knowledge gaps regarding indications, adverse effects, interval, and simultaneous vaccination. These multifactorial issues combine to produce lower population immunization rates and a higher incidence of VPD than other developed countries. This article will provide insight into the current situation of Japanese vaccinations, the issues to be addressed and suggestions for public health promotion.',\n",
       " 'At the World Economic Forum in 2010, The Gates Foundation announced the \"Decade of Vaccines,\" a $10 billion commitment to increase access to existing and new childhood vaccines. It is estimated that this effort could save 6.4 million lives and avert 426 million illnesses [1, 2] Achieving these goals will require a significant effort among global health agencies, non-governmental organizations, industry and national governments to support vaccine development and ensure a strong infrastructure for sustainable vaccine delivery. Vaccines are one of the most important public health achievements in history, resulting in significant decreases in the prevalence of many childhood diseases. However, persistent disparities exist in the adoption of new vaccines and sustained vaccination rates in both developed and developing countries. Decreasing vaccination rates in some communities have resulted in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Disparities may be due to vaccine supply, poor infrastructure, or low prioritization of vaccines for public health spending. However, another crucial contributor to the success of vaccination programs is vaccine acceptance.',\n",
       " 'The recent vigorous transnational migration of people and materials reflecting the development of transportation facilities, changes in social structure, and war disasters has increased the global spread of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Vaccine, which is the major fundamental prophylaxis against infectious diseases, has greatly contributed to the maintenance and improvement of human health worldwide. However, the disadvantages of conventional injection systems hamper the speedy mass-vaccination and the global distribution of vaccines. Transcutaneous immunization systems, which are easy-to-use and low-invasive methods of vaccination, have the potential to overcome certain issues associated with injectable vaccinations. In this review, we provide an outline of recent trends in the development of techniques for the transcutaneous delivery of vaccine antigens. We also introduce basic and clinical research involving our transcutaneous immunization systems that incorporate self-dissolving microneedle patch.',\n",
       " \"Parental decision making about childhood vaccinations is complex and multidimensional. There is a perception that the number of parents having concerns regarding childhood vaccinations has been increasing in Canada. The aim of this study was to explore vaccine hesitancy among Canadian parents and to examine factors associated with a parent's intention to vaccinate his/her child. Informed by the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) this study assesses potential associations between parents' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs toward vaccination and their intention to vaccinate their child in the future. A national sample of Canadian parents of children aged 24-59\\u202fmonths (N\\u202f=\\u202f2013) was surveyed using an online survey methodology. Half of the surveyed parents strongly intended to have their child vaccinated in the future. Parents' information needs and searches as well as parents' trust in different institutions were associated with intention to vaccinate. Parents who reported having frequently looked for vaccine information, who considered that it was their role as parents to question vaccines, or who had previously experienced difficulty accessing vaccination services were less likely to strongly intend to vaccinate their child in the future. Parents who had a high level of trust in doctors and public health were most likely to strongly intend to vaccinate their child. Results of the multivariate analysis showed that positive attitudes (aOR\\u202f=\\u202f8.0; 95% CI: 6.0, 10.4), higher perceived social support (aOR\\u202f=\\u202f3.0; 95% CI: 2.3, 3.93), and higher perceived behavioural control (aOR\\u202f=\\u202f1.8; 95% CI: 1.4, 2.43) were associated with parents' intention to vaccinate their child. Findings of this study suggest that trust-building interventions that promote pro-vaccine social norms and that address negative attitudes toward vaccination could enhance vaccine acceptance among Canadian parents.\",\n",
       " 'Vaccinating pregnant women in order to protect them, the fetus, and the child has become universal in no way at all. Prejudice in health professionals add to fears of women and their families. Both these feelings are not supported by even the smallest scientific data. Harmlessness for the mother and the child has been observed for seasonal, pandemic, or quadrivalent influenza, mono, combined polysaccharide or conjugated meningococcal or pneumococcal, tetanus toxoid, acellular pertussis, human papillomavirus, cholera, hepatitis A, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, anthrax, smallpox, yellow fever, mumps, measles and rubella combined, typhoid fever, inactivated or attenuated polio vaccines, and Bacillus Calmétte Guerin vaccines. Instead, the beneficial effects of influenza vaccine for the mother and the child as well as of pertussis vaccine for the child have been demonstrated. Obstetrician-gynecologists, general practitioners, and midwives must incorporate vaccination into their standard clinical care. Strong communication strategies effective at reducing parental vaccine hesitancy and approval of regulatory agencies for use of vaccines during pregnancy are needed. It must be clear that the lack of pre-licensure studies in pregnant women and, consequently, the lack of a statement about the use of the vaccine in pregnant women does not preclude its use in pregnancy.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Newly arrived refugees are offered vaccinations during domestic medical examinations. Vaccination practices and costs for refugees have not been described with recent implementation of the overseas Vaccination Program for U.S.-bound Refugees (VPR). We describe refugee vaccination during the domestic medical examination and the estimated vaccination costs from the US government perspective in selected U.S. clinics. METHODS: Site-specific vaccination processes and costs were collected from 16 clinics by refugee health partners in three states and one private academic institution. Vaccination costs were estimated from the U.S. Vaccines for Children Program and Medicaid reimbursement rates during fiscal year 2015. RESULTS: All clinics reviewed overseas vaccination records before vaccinating, but all records were not transferred into state immunization systems. Average vaccination costs per refugee varied from $120 to $211 by site. The total average cost of domestic vaccination was 15% less among refugees arriving from VPR- vs. nonVPR-participating countries during a single domestic visit. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that immunization practices and costs vary between clinics, and that clinics adapted their vaccination practices to accommodate VPR doses, yielding potential cost savings.',\n",

There are multiple methods of vaccination against influenza, including inactivated and live vaccines that are approved and recommended for children and adults over 6 months of age, but there is no vaccine that protects against seasonal influenza for children <6 months of age. This group is at a high risk of severe illness and is associated with higher rates of hospitalization and mortality during the influenza season. In absence of an available vaccine, approaches protecting young infants from influenza must be taken seriously. These methods include vaccinating pregnant women for influenza as a method of protecting mothers and the fetus as well as vaccinating caregivers and close contacts of individuals in this age group.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Appropriate provider recommendation is crucial to raising HPV vaccination uptake, yet scant research has explored actual conversations between providers and parents, the effect of parental pre-visit vaccine intention on vaccination, or the effect of conversation style on parental satisfaction with that conversation. METHODS: We analyzed 146 audio-recorded clinical encounters between providers, parents/guardians, and HPV vaccine-eligible adolescents, from May 2015 to March 2017, at eight practices in Northeastern U.S. Parents completed pre-visit measures of intent to vaccinate and post-visit assessments of satisfaction with vaccine conversations. We qualitatively analyzed transcribed audio recordings and evaluated associations between providers\\' vaccine introductions and vaccine receipt. RESULTS: Provider recommendations were empirically defined as \"indicated\" (clear recommendation that the child receive HPV vaccination at that visit), \"elective\" (vaccination presented as optional), or \"contraindicated\" (delay recommended). The vaccination rates were 87%, 68%, and 0% following \"indicated,\" \"elective,\" and \"contraindicated\" presentations respectively. Providers\\' statements attesting to the vaccine\\'s value to the child did not affect receipt. Parental pre-visit intent to vaccinate was associated with vaccine receipt: 100% for likely/very likely compared to 28% for very unlikely. The association between vaccine recommendation style and vaccine receipt was most pronounced with undecided parents, with 92% accepting vaccination after an \"indicated\" recommendation vs. 68% after an \"elective\" recommendation. Satisfaction with vaccine conversations was high regardless of recommendation style. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the words used to introduce HPV vaccination have the potential to inform parents\\' HPV vaccination decisions. Providers should be encouraged to simply state, \"Your child is due for the HPV vaccine today.\"',\n",
       " \"INTRODUCTION: The introduction of new vaccines highlights concerns about high vaccine wastage, knowledge of wastage policies and quality of stock management. However, an emphasis on minimizing wastage rates may cause confusion when recommendations are also being made to reduce missed opportunities to routinely vaccinate children. This concern is most relevant for lyophilized vaccines without preservatives [e.g. measles-containing vaccine (MCV)], which can be used for a limited time once reconstituted. METHODS: We sampled 54 health facilities within 11 local government areas (LGAs) in Nigeria and surveyed health sector personnel regarding routine vaccine usage and wastage-related knowledge and practices, conducted facility exit interviews with caregivers of children about missed opportunities for routine vaccination, and abstracted vaccine stock records and vaccination session data over a 6-month period to calculate wastage rates and vaccine vial usage patterns. RESULTS: Nearly half of facilities had incomplete vaccine stock data for calculating wastage rates. Among facilities with sufficient data, mean monthly facility-level wastage rates were between 18 and 35% across all reviewed vaccines, with little difference between lyophilized and liquid vaccines. Most (98%) vaccinators believed high wastage led to recent vaccine stockouts, yet only 55% were familiar with the multi-dose vial policy for minimizing wastage. On average, vaccinators reported that a minimum of six children must be present prior to opening a 10-dose MCV vial. Third dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (DTP3) was administered in 84% of sessions and MCV in 63%; however, the number of MCV and DTP3 doses administered were similar indicating the number of children vaccinated with DTP3 and MCV were similar despite less frequent MCV vaccination opportunities. Among caregivers, 30% reported being turned away for vaccination at least once; 53% of these children had not yet received the missed dose. DISCUSSION: Our findings show inadequate implementation of vaccine management guidelines, missed opportunities to vaccinate, and lyophilized vaccine wastage rates below expected rates. Missed opportunities for vaccination may occur due to how the health system's contradicting policies may force health workers to prioritize reduced wastage rates over vaccine administration, particularly for multi-dose vials.\",\n",
       " 'Most vaccines available in the United States have been incorporated into vaccination schedules for infants and young children, age groups particularly at risk of contracting infectious diseases. High universal vaccination coverage is responsible for substantially reducing or nearly eliminating many of the diseases that once killed thousands of children each year in the US. Despite the success of infant vaccinations, periods of low vaccination coverage and the limited immunogenicity and duration of protection of certain vaccines have resulted in sporadic outbreaks, allowing some diseases to spread in communities. These challenges suggest that expanded vaccination coverage to younger infants and adolescents, and more immunogenic vaccines, may be needed in some instances. This review focuses on the importance of infant immunization and explores the successes and challenges of current early childhood vaccination programs and how these lessons may be applied to other invasive diseases, such as meningococcal disease.',\n",
       " 'Infant immunization is a particularly important field with multiple challenges for vaccine research and development. There is, together with a high susceptibility to infections, a lower efficacy of most vaccinations in newborns and young infants, compared to those performed later in life. In the present review, the authors focus on problems arising from the attempt to vaccinate against pathogens very early in life, and on the role of selective adjuvants (i.e. antigen delivery systems or immunomodulators) that could be used to: (i) rapidly induce strong antibody responses of the appropriate isotypes; (ii) elicit sustained antibody responses extending beyond infancy; (iii) induce efficient Th1 and CTL responses in spite of the preferential Th2 polarization of early life responses; (iv) escape from maternal antibody mediated inhibition of vaccine responses; (v) show acceptable reactogenicity in early life; and (vi) allow incorporation of several vaccine antigens into a single formulation so as to reduce the number of required injections. How such objectives might be achieved by several of the vaccine formulations currently in development is illustrated by reviewing data from experimental models and clinical studies, when available.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: National population-based immunization coverage surveys provide data for validating official administrative coverage figures. However, these costly and logistically challenging surveys are conducted infrequently. This hospital-based records review determined coverage of birth-dose vaccines, fully immunized under 1-y-old coverage (FIC) of 12- to 59-mo-old children; and the reasons for missed vaccinations. METHODS: Rotavirus surveillance in South Africa is based on under-5-y-old children being treated for diarrhoea, and includes photocopying the official vaccination document and collecting data on reasons for missed vaccinations. These data were captured from all 508 records collected from 2011 to 2014, and subjected to descriptive statistical analysis. RESULTS: Bacille Calmette Guérin coverage was 99%; oral polio vaccine birth dose (OPV(0)) coverage was 99%. Coverage for 12- to 59-mo-olds ranged from 75% for the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine third dose to 99% for OPV(0). Several instances of subsequent doses being recorded without prior doses being received resulted in a FIC of 55%. In total, 207 vaccinations were missed by 88 children. Vaccine stock-outs were responsible for 62% of missed vaccinations. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve vaccine stock management at facility and district levels should be implemented, and should include vaccinator training and supervision to eliminate vaccine stock-outs and missed vaccination opportunities.',\n",
       " 'Adolescents were first specifically targeted for school-located vaccination (SLV) in the 1990s when hepatitis B catch-up vaccination was recommended for all adolescents. SLV affords the opportunity to access adolescents at a time when their activities have developmental import and the patients have the capacity to decline repeatedly missing school and extracurricular events to get vaccinated. As noted above, SLV has been primarily reserved for brief catch-up interventions among youth, with routine vaccination recommendations quickly defaulting to the primary care provider. Now in 2016, with relatively disappointing adolescent immunization rates for the routinely recommended human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, the SLV option is one that could potentially help increase vaccination rates for a particularly effective, life-saving, 3-dose vaccination series. This article will serve as a brief review of the successful use of SLV in other countries, lessons learned when SLV was employed to immunize adolescents against hepatitis B in the United States in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and the current hopes and challenges for the future of adolescent SLV programming in the United States. Overall, the shift to the use of SLV to administer routinely recommend vaccine for adolescents will require careful planning to implement known strategies for accessing youth and in addition to new strategies designed to assure appropriate reimbursement for cost-effect SLV services. While not the best option for all adolescents, SLV provides an important opportunity to immunize youth with limited access to healthcare services in the community at large.',\n",
       " \"Orf, a parapoxvirus, is a zoonosis causing a contagious pustular dermatitis, and has a high morbidity in sheep worldwide. Despite a vaccine being available, orf prevalence in England is estimated to be 2 per cent in ewes and 20 per cent in lambs\\u200b\\u200b. There is concern that farmers are not complying with the vaccination guidelines and therefore the objective of this study was to investigate if orf vaccine is used correctly on sheep farms in the UK and to identify barriers and motivators of sheep farmers to use the vaccine. The survey was completed by 570 respondents. The results show several areas of concern; only 27 per cent of respondents used the correct site (axilla), 37 per cent of respondents would use orf vaccine up to a week after opening a vial (shelf life is eight\\u2009hours), 33 per cent of respondents would vaccinate their ewes too close to lambing and 73 per cent of respondents did not separate vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals (both leading to infection risk for non-vaccinated animals). When vaccinating, only 53 per cent of respondents were wearing gloves and 31 per cent washed their hands just before and immediately after vaccination. Results demonstrate that orf vaccination is not carried out correctly on all UK sheep farms, which is likely to affect vaccine efficacy. A concern around vaccine efficacy, the 'hassle' of the scratch administration, the 'risk of making it worse' and the zoonotic risk when vaccinating were the most common barriers for using orf vaccine, highlighting the importance of veterinary advice when prescribing orf vaccine.\",\n",
       " 'A number of different vaccination techniques are applied in farm animals. The intramuscular, subcutaneous and intradermal injection of vaccines are parenteral application methods that are currently used for different attenuated and inactivated vaccines. The injection may be performed by needle or pressure. Depending on the method of application, the mucosal immunization can be performed intraocular, intranasal and/or oral. In general, the vaccine follows the natural route of infection of the respective pathogen. Attenuated vaccines usually replicate in the primary target organs. Mucosal application of attenuated vaccines via drinking water or spray are routinely applied in poultry. Both techniques offer advantages for mass application. The administration route and the method of vaccination have a great influence on the efficacy and safety of a vaccine. The instructions of the manufacturers must therefore be strictly respected. Unfortunately, there is no ideal administration method applicable for any vaccine in all species.',\n",

       " 'This chapter reviews the most common neurologic disorders associated with common vaccines, evaluates the data linking the disorder with the vaccine, and discusses the potential mechanism of disease. A literature search was conducted in PubMed using a combination of the following terms: vaccines, vaccination, immunization, and neurologic complications. Data were also gathered from publications of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. Neurologic complications of vaccination are rare. Many associations have been asserted without objective data to support a causal relationship. Rarely, patients with a neurologic complication will have a poor outcome. However, most patients recover fully from the neurologic complication. Vaccinations have altered the landscape of infectious disease. However, perception of risk associated with vaccinations has limited the success of disease eradication measures. Neurologic complications can be severe, and can provoke fear in potential vaccines. Evaluating whether there is causal link between neurologic disorders and vaccinations, not just temporal association, is critical to addressing public misperception of risk of vaccination. Among the vaccines available today, the cost-benefit analysis of vaccinations and complications strongly argues in favor of vaccination.',\n",

In-person interviews are conducted throughout the year in a probability sample of households, and NHIS data are compiled and released annually. The survey objective is to monitor the health of the U.S. population and provide estimates of health indicators, health care use and access, and health-related behaviors. RESULTS: Compared with data from the 2014 NHIS, increases in vaccination coverage occurred for influenza vaccine among adults aged ≥19 years (a 1.6 percentage point increase compared with the 2013-14 season to 44.8%), pneumococcal vaccine among adults aged 19-64 years at increased risk for pneumococcal disease (a 2.8 percentage point increase to 23.0%), Tdap vaccine among adults aged ≥19 years and adults aged 19-64 years (a 3.1 percentage point and 3.3 percentage point increase to 23.1% and to 24.7%, respectively), herpes zoster vaccine among adults aged ≥60 years and adults aged ≥65 years (a 2.7 percentage point and 3.2 percentage point increase to 30.6% and to 34.2%, respectively), and hepatitis B vaccine among health care personnel (HCP) aged ≥19 years (a 4.1 percentage point increase to 64.7%). Herpes zoster vaccination coverage in 2015 met the Healthy People 2020 target of 30%. Aside from these modest improvements, vaccination coverage among adults in 2015 was similar to estimates from 2014. Racial/ethnic differences in coverage persisted for all seven vaccines, with higher coverage generally for whites compared with most other groups. Adults without health insurance reported receipt of influenza vaccine (all age groups), pneumococcal vaccine (adults aged 19-64 years at increased risk), Td vaccine (adults aged ≥19 years, 19-64 years, and 50-64 years), Tdap vaccine (adults aged ≥19 years and 19-64 years), hepatitis A vaccine (adults aged ≥19 years overall and among travelers), hepatitis B vaccine (adults aged ≥19 years, 19-49 years, and among travelers), herpes zoster vaccine (adults aged ≥60 years), and HPV vaccine (males and females aged 19-26 years) less often than those with health insurance. Adults who reported having a usual place for health care generally reported receipt of recommended vaccinations more often than those who did not have such a place, regardless of whether they had health insurance. Vaccination coverage was higher among adults reporting one or more physician contacts in the past year compared with those who had not visited a physician in the past year, regardless of whether they had health insurance. Even among adults who had health insurance and ≥10 physician contacts within the past year, depending on the vaccine, 18.2%-85.6% reported not having received vaccinations that were recommended either for all persons or for those with specific indications. Overall, vaccination coverage among U.S.-born adults was higher than that among foreign-born adults, with few exceptions (influenza vaccination [adults aged 19-49 years and 50-64 years], hepatitis A vaccination [adults aged ≥19 years], and hepatitis B vaccination [adults aged ≥19 years with diabetes or chronic liver conditions]). INTERPRETATION: Coverage for all vaccines for adults remained low but modest gains occurred in vaccination coverage for influenza (adults aged ≥19 years), pneumococcal (adults aged 19-64 years with increased risk), Tdap (adults aged ≥19 years and adults aged 19-64 years), herpes zoster (adults aged ≥60 years and ≥65 years), and hepatitis B (HCP aged ≥19 years); coverage for other vaccines and groups with vaccination indications did not improve. The 30% Healthy People 2020 target for herpes zoster vaccination was met. Racial/ethnic disparities persisted for routinely recommended adult vaccines. Missed opportunities to vaccinate remained. Although having health insurance coverage and a usual place for health care were associated with higher vaccination coverage, these factors alone were not associated with optimal adult vaccination coverage. HPV vaccination coverage for males and females has increased since CDC recommended vaccination to prevent cancers caused by HPV, but many adolescents and young adults remained unvaccinated. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: Assessing factors associated with low coverage rates and disparities in vaccination is important for implementing strategies to improve vaccination coverage. Evidence-based practices that have been demonstrated to improve vaccination coverage should be used. These practices include assessment of patients' vaccination indications by health care providers and routine recommendation and offer of needed vaccines to adults, implementation of reminder-recall systems, use of standing-order programs for vaccination, and assessment of practice-level vaccination rates with feedback to staff members. For vaccination coverage to be improved among those who reported lower coverage rates of recommended adult vaccines, efforts also are needed to identify adults who do not have a regular provider or insurance and who report fewer health care visits.\",\n",
       " \"OBJECTIVES: Vaccination of healthcare personnel (HCP) is an effective measure for preventing the spread of influenza among at-risk patients. This study was conducted to determine influenza vaccination rates and activities among HCP working at a tertiary healthcare setting. METHODS: This study included 470 HCP (85 physicians, 134 nurses, 53 healthcare assistants, 44 paramedics, 47 medical secretaries, and 107 auxillary staff members) working at the emergency, cardiology, chest diseases, and internal medicine departments with the largest volume of patients with vaccination indication of two large university hospitals with similar medical practices and work environment. Each participant completed an anonymous questionnaire form. RESULTS: A total of 470 HCP participated in the survey. The compliance rate of the HCP to participate in the survey was 93.6%. Of these, 26.7% had been vaccinated against influenza. Vaccination in the survey year was significantly associated with having regular influenza vaccinations (OR 48.66; 95% CI:[25.09-94.369]; P<.01); having an educational level of college or higher (OR 2.07; 95% CI:[1.03-4.15]; P<.05); being a physician (OR 4.25; 95% CI:[1.28-14.07]; P< .05); and a professional experience of more than 5\\xa0years (OR 2.02; 95%CI:[1.13-5.62]; P< .05). Physicians recommended and prescribed the influenza vaccine significantly more frequently than the pneumococcal vaccine (37.6% vs 30.6%, P = .03, 25.9% vs 17.6%, P = .001, respectively). Among all HCP, the reasons for vaccination included having the opinion that the vaccine provides a partial protection against the infection (75.2%), reduces work force loss (48.8%), reduces the rates of death and severe conditions like pneumonia (43.2%), and reduces hospitalization (40.8%). The HCP had been vaccinated to protect family members (81.6%), people around (51.2%),\\xa0herself/himself (47.2%), and patients (28%) fom infection. The reasons of not getting vaccinated against influenza among HCP included fear of vaccine's adverse effects (31.0%), doubts about its efficacy (28.9%) and safety (22.3%), and lack of adequate knowledge about vaccination (16.2%). CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that influenza vaccination rates are low in our whole HCP sample, with physicians having a slightly better rate than other HCP. Getting regularly vaccinated, having an educational level of college or higher, being a physician, and having a professional experience of more than 5\\xa0years positively affects the rate of future vaccinations. Physicians significantly more commonly recommended and prescribed the influenza vaccine than the pneumococcal vaccine. The most important reasons for getting vaccinated included having the opinion that the vaccine provided partial protection and intending to protect family members from infection. In our whole HCP sample, the reasons of not getting vaccinated against influenza included fear of vaccine's adverse effects and doubts about its efficacy and safety. Training meetings should be held for HCPs to underscore the importance of the influenza vaccine for protection of patients against the influenza.\",\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: Vaccination against seasonal influenza is usually very protective. However, coverage in service workers is low due to the large population density and high turnover. The aim of this study was to document the knowledge, attitudes and practices towards the influenza vaccine among young service workers. METHODS: A face-to-face interview and questionnaire were administered at the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention (GZCDC) clinic. The questionnaires were analyzed to evaluate knowledge, attitudes and willingness to vaccinate in the service industry population. RESULTS: Overall, the response rate was 81.37% (1035/1272). Most of the participants had faith in the efficacy (94.20%) and safety (94.88%) of the influenza vaccine. A total of 88.7% of the respondents confirmed that children needed to be vaccinated compared to other subjects, including those who work with baby and children (45.89%), elderly people (38.95%), medical staff (38.95%) and chronic disease patients (27.33%). Only 6.47% of the respondents were clearly aware of the vaccination timeframe. One-fifth of the respondents (18.16%) reported being vaccinated within the last three years, representing a low voluntary vaccination rate (23.94%) and a high irregular vaccination rate (77.13%). The primary reason for ignoring the importance of vaccination was that the respondents believed that they were strong enough to not require immunization (42.19%). In the multivariate analysis, the main determinants of the participants' willingness to continue to vaccinate were their beliefs in vaccine protection, a high education level, vaccination behavior over the last 3\\xa0years and belief in the necessity of annual vaccinations. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide insights into the knowledge, attitudes and practices of the service industry population prior to vaccination season in Guangzhou City. Most participants had a passive attitude toward the influenza vaccine, but there was still relatively low knowledge and implementation of the vaccine. Governments and health departments at all levels should develop a long-term strategy for fiscal subsidy policies and new health education patterns to enhance both the recognition and coverage of the influenza vaccine and to protect the citizens as a whole from infection. There is an urgent need for the pharmaceutical industries to develop a universal vaccine and to enhance the efficacy of vaccination.\",\n",
       " 'Upon exposure to vaccine-preventable diseases, certain individuals are at increased risk for complications due to preexisting diseases, age or immunosuppressive treatment. Vaccination against influenza, pneumococcal disease and hepatitis B (for some groups) is advised in addition to standard vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. We estimated the vaccination coverage and determinants of recommended vaccinations in patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 (n\\xa0=\\xa0173) and type 2 (n\\xa0=\\xa0177), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (n\\xa0=\\xa0138), heart failure (n\\xa0=\\xa0200), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n\\xa0=\\xa0187), HIV (n\\xa0=\\xa0201) or solid organ transplantation (SOT) (n\\xa0=\\xa0201) in a monocentric study. Vaccination data were retrieved from documents provided by patients and general practitioners, and from the Flemish vaccination register. Less than 10% had received all recommended vaccines. Overall, 29% of subjects were vaccinated against diphtheria-tetanus, 10% against pertussis, 44% against influenza, 32% against pneumococcal disease and 24% of HIV patients and 31% of CKD patients against hepatitis B. Age was positively associated with vaccination against influenza (OR:2.0, p <\\xa0.01) and pneumococcal disease (OR:2.6, p <\\xa0.001). Patients with COPD, HIV and SOT were more likely to be vaccinated against influenza (OR:2.8, p <\\xa0.001, OR:1.8, p <\\xa0.05; OR:2.0, p <\\xa0.001, respectively) and pneumococcal disease (OR:2.9, p <\\xa0.001, OR:25.0, p <\\xa0.001; OR:2.6, p <\\xa0.001, respectively) than patients with heart failure. Reason for non-vaccination were concerns about effectiveness, necessity and side effects of influenza vaccines, and not being aware of the recommendation for pneumococcal disease. Initiatives to monitor the vaccination status of vulnerable patients are needed, which is why we advocate systematic vaccination registration and frequent communication about vaccination.',\n",
       " 'The Italian National Vaccine Prevention Plan (PNPV) of 2017-19 and subsequent mandatory vaccination law (Law 119/2017) both occurred in the context of a progressive decrease in vaccine coverage levels in Italy and led to important policy changes, including the introduction of new vaccine recommendations and increasing the number of mandatory vaccinations in childhood from four to ten. A survey on a sample of 446 Italian health care workers (HCW) was carried out in order to assess their opinions on policy changes introduced by the PNPV and by the mandatory vaccination law. The convenience sample was selected among participants in a training course on vaccination counselling. The large majority of participants expressed overall satisfaction about the policy changes introduced by the PNPV but some highlighted pitfalls related to its implementation. Moreover, the majority of HCW believe that vaccination coverage for both recommended and mandatory vaccinations has increased thanks to Law 119/2017, therefore expressing a positive attitude towards the enforcement of vaccine mandates.',\n",
       " 'A vaccine to protect sheep, goats, and bovines against hydatid disease caused by the cysts of Echinococcus granulosus is prepared as a recombinant fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli. Solubilised inclusion bodies are injected, together with Quil A, subcutaneously on two occasions 1 month or more apart, and induce protection against infection which lasts for at least 12 months. A third injection given 6-12 months after the second injection induces a high and long-lasting protection against artificial or natural challenge infections. This review describes work carried out on the formulation, safety and efficacy of the vaccine under laboratory and field conditions, using artificial or natural challenges with E. granulosus eggs, followed by necropsy. Hydatid control programmes based on regular treatment of all dogs with the correct dose of a highly-efficient anthelmintic have sometimes not been successful in Continental environments. Access to dogs is difficult in summer because of the distances to summer pastures, and is often impossible in winter because of snow. A control program using strategic twice-yearly anthelmintic treatment of dogs is likely to be successful provided grazing animals are vaccinated as well. Vaccination as a control tool only requires the veterinarians to visit two times a year, and while the veterinarian is present, the dogs can be treated with anthelmintic for little additional cost. One visit should take place after the autumn kill of animals for winter consumption, and this is a good time to vaccinate animals born in the summer, and also all other animals while they are healthy and immunologically responsive. The other visit should take place in the spring, at which time animals born during winter can be vaccinated. Although a single immunization has been shown to induce a useful degree of protection, where possible it is best to give two initial injections, 1 month apart. If it is possible for veterinarians to stay in the field for 2 months in November/December and March/April, in order to give the two injections, a more rapid onset of full protective immunity will initially be achieved than if the injections are given 6 months apart. A large-scale safety and efficacy trial involving 50,000 and 100,000 lambs in Qinghai and Xinjiang Provinces of China has taken place. Results have confirmed safety and efficacy. In most countries, prevalence of infection increases with age. The vaccine has no effect on established cysts, and therefore, in order to prevent the biomass of Echinococcus spp. from increasing, it might be an effective strategy to begin a control programme by vaccinating all animals. Because many of the older stock will already be infected, they will remain a source of infection for dogs for the average lifetime of the stock. Dogs will still be able to be infected from the older stock, and will continue to infect humans. We advocate that a vaccination programme be accompanied by education about hydatid disease, and anthelmintic treatment of dogs in late autumn and early spring.',\n",
       " 'Advocates of homeopathic vaccines, also known as nosodes, reimagined the risks and benefits of vaccination from 1999 to 2015 by comparing \"risky\" vaccines to \"risk-free\" nosodes. I argue that nosodes allowed for a complementary argument to anti-vaccine discourse, fundamentally altering what had been framed as a choice between the risks of vaccination and the risks of vaccine-preventable disease. Despite evidence of their efficacy being flawed, advocates presented nosodes as an alternative to vaccines and a middle ground between anti-vaccination and vaccination. While a campaign from 2013 to 2015 tried to expose nosodes as ineffective, I argue that the campaign was unsuccessful. Instead, the mainstream media brought more attention to nosodes. The history of nosodes further complicates the history of vaccines and alternative medicine in Canada by adding vaccine alternatives to the growing literature on vaccine hesitancy.',\n",
       " 'Vaccination is a key protective factor against COVID-19. Some vaccines have already received emergency authorization from Health Agencies, but growing skepticism and vaccine hesitancy will probably affect COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. In the attempt to shed light on this issue, we conducted an online survey in a population of parents referring to 4 pediatric practices in Naples, Italy in whom we evaluated potential vaccine acceptability in relation to socio-demographic characteristics, perception of personal health and of the impact of COVID-19, and attitudes toward general vaccination practices. Vaccination rates were analyzed also in the corresponding pediatric population.Almost 27% of participants declared they were in favor of vaccinations, and in fact real life vaccination rates in children exceeded the national mean. Only 26.5% of respondents declared they would receive COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine refusal was attributed to safety concerns in 76% of parents. Specific vaccine attributes further reduced the acceptance rate. Female gender, younger age and lower education level were associated with non-adherence to vaccination. Among extrinsic factors of COVID-19 vaccination, only information from National Health Authorities was significantly associated to vaccine acceptance.The rate of potential COVID-19 vaccine acceptability was very poor in our population of parents. Vaccine hesitancy was mainly due to safety concerns. Demographic and educational factors were correlated to vaccine acceptability. Health education and communication strategies are needed to achieve large-scale vaccine acceptability and finally herd immunity.',\n",
       " \"The increasing numbers of vaccine-hesitant parents poses a threat to personal and public health through a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases. Understanding the factors underlying vaccine-hesitant parents' fears is a necessary step toward designing interventions to overcome them. Educational interventions appear more successful when combined with personal interactions. Providers are the most important influence on parental vaccine decisions. Research should focus on designing effective interventions that facilitate effective parent-provider communication around this issue.\",\n",
       " \"OBJECTIVES: Health care providers influence parental vaccination decisions. Over 90% of parents report receiving vaccine information from their child's health care provider. The majority of parents of vaccinated children and children exempt from school immunization requirements report their child's primary provider is a good source for vaccine information. The role of health care providers in influencing parents who refuse vaccines has not been fully explored. The objective of the study was to determine the association between vaccine-related attitudes and beliefs of health care providers and parents. METHODS: We surveyed parents and primary care providers of vaccinated and unvaccinated school age children in four states in 2002-2003 and 2005. We measured key immunization beliefs including perceived risks and benefits of vaccination. Odds ratios for associations between parental and provider responses were calculated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 1367 parents (56.1% response rate) and 551 providers (84.3% response rate). Parents with high confidence in vaccine safety were more likely to have providers with similar beliefs, however viewpoints regarding disease susceptibility and severity and vaccine efficacy were not associated. Parents whose providers believed that children get more immunizations than are good for them had 4.6 higher odds of holding that same belief compared to parents whose providers did not have that belief. CONCLUSIONS: The beliefs of children's health care providers and parents, including those regarding vaccine safety, are similar. Provider beliefs may contribute to parental decisions to accept, delay or forgo vaccinations. Parents may selectively choose providers who have similar beliefs to their own.\",\n",
       " 'A case of illegal vaccine sales in Shandong province, China, (hereinafter, the incident), which caused a lack of confidence among vaccination recipients and public panic, was uncovered in March 2016. We conducted a study comprising two cross-sectional surveys: at two months (May 2016) and seven months (October 2016) after the incident. The study aimed to evaluate the impact on immunizations; investigate the variation of the immunization coverage of the National Immunization Program Vaccines (NIPV) and the sales volume growth rate of Category II vaccines; and understand the reasons for non-vaccination and perspectives on immunization. The immunization coverage of NIPV decreased by 5.6 percentage points in the first survey, with a decline of 11.1 in the region of the incident, and decreased by 0.6 in the second survey compared to same period in 2015. The sales volume growth rate of Category II vaccines decreased by 25.8% in the study area and by 48.8% in the region of the incident in April 2016 compared to April 2015. Overall, 15.8% of respondents in the first survey and 7.0% in the second survey did not vaccinate their children according to the NIPV schedule because of the incident (χ(2) = 78.463, P < 0.05). The vaccination was likely affected by the incident in varying degrees, especially in the involved region and particularly in relation to Category II vaccines. Overall, 34% of respondents avoided Category II vaccines for their children, indicating that it will take considerable time to eliminate the negative stigma associated with the incident.',\n",
       " \"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Immunocompromised children are a largely under-vaccinated population and are vulnerable to acquiring vaccine-preventable infections (VPIs). A variety of factors contribute to poor vaccine coverage including: severity of underlying illness, sporadic contact with primary care physicians, and lack of awareness among specialty providers regarding vaccination status. In this review, we report recent data regarding incidence of VPIs, new approaches to vaccine use, rates of vaccine coverage, and strategies to optimize vaccine administration in immunocompromised populations. RECENT FINDINGS: Pediatric transplant recipients and patients with autoimmune disorders receiving novel biological therapies, represent growing immunocompromised patient populations. VPIs continue to be a concern for such patients. Underlying disease severity may limit efforts to immunize pediatric patients early in their disease process, prior to immunosuppression. Inactive vaccines are safe and immunogenic after the introduction of immunosuppression, but live vaccines are typically contraindicated. Emerging data support the safety and effectiveness of live vaccines in certain immunocompromised individuals. Care providers must remain vigilant in maintaining patients' vaccination status based on current vaccination guidelines, and create a multidisciplinary approach to optimizing vaccination. SUMMARY: Immunocompromised children remain under-vaccinated and vulnerable to VPIs. Optimizing vaccines should be a priority for every provider caring for this population.\",\n",
       " 'BackgroundChildhood vaccination schedules recommend vaccine doses at predefined ages.AimWe evaluated vaccination completeness and timeliness in Jerusalem, a district with recurrent vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks.MethodsVaccination coverage was monitored by the up-to-date method (vaccination completeness at age 2 years). Timeliness of vaccination was assessed in children (n\\u2009=\\u20093,098, born in 2009, followed to age 48 months, re-evaluated at age 7 years) by the age-appropriate method (vaccine dose timeliness according to recommended schedule). Vaccines included: hepatitis B (HBV: birth, 1 month and 6 months); diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, polio, Haemophilus influenzae b (DTaP-IPV-Hib: 2, 4, 6 and 12 months); pneumococcal conjugate (PCV: 2, 4 and 12 months); measles-mumps-rubella/measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMR/MMRV: 12 months) and hepatitis A (HAV: 18 and 24 months).ResultsOverall vaccination coverage (2014 cohort evaluated at age 2 years) was 95% and 86% for MMR/MMRV and DTaP-IPV-Hib4, respectively. Most children (94%, 91%, 79%, 95%, 92% and 82%) were up-to-date for HBV3, DTaP-IPV-Hib4, PCV3, MMR/MMRV1, HAV1 and HAV2 vaccines at 48 months, but only 32%, 28%, 38%, 58%, 49% and 20% were vaccinated timely (age-appropriate). At age 7 years, the median increase in vaccination coverage was 2.4%. Vaccination delay was associated with: high birth order, ethnicity (higher among Jews vs Arabs), birth in winter, delayed acceptance of first dose of DTaP-IPV-Hib and multiple-dose vaccines (vs MMR/MMRV). Jewish ultra-Orthodox communities had low vaccination coverage.ConclusionsConsiderable vaccination delay should be addressed within the vaccine hesitancy spectrum. Delays may induce susceptibility to vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks; tailored programmes to improve timeliness are required.',\n",
       " \"OBJECTIVE: Monitoring of vaccination coverage rates (VCRs) is essential to assess the implementation of a country's vaccine policy and its effectiveness. Through the French Vaccinoscopy study, we measured the evolution of VCRs as well as mothers' opinion towards vaccination between 2008 and 2018, before and after implementation of infant mandatory vaccination extension. METHODS: This is a study based on an internet-standardised questionnaire. In 2018, a representative sample of 3000 mothers of infants 0 to 35 months of age answered on their opinion on vaccination and reported all vaccinations recorded in their child's health record. RESULTS: On the period considered, infant VCRs were stable and high for diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis, pertussis and pneumococcus components and progressed for measles, mumps rubella, 2 doses at 24 months of age from 45.3% in 2008 to 81.0% in 2018, hepatitis B (HepB) complete primovaccination at 6 months of age from 45.9% in 2008 to 86.3% in 2017 and 95.5% in 2018, and meningococcus C (MenC) 1 dose at 6 months of age from 43.0% in 2017 to 74.2% in 2018. In 2018, 69.0% of mothers were in favour of vaccination while this rate dropped from 80.2% in 2012 to 64.0% in 2017, and 80.8 to 89.6% perceived HepB, MenC measles and pertussis vaccinations as useful/essential, percentages in progress versus 2017. CONCLUSION: Following the implementation of infant mandatory vaccination in 2018, proportion of mothers in favour of vaccination increased significantly. HepB and MenC VCRs significantly progressed between 2017 and 2018.\",\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVE: Vaccine stockouts are prevalent in Africa. Despite the importance of this as a barrier to universal vaccination coverage, rigorous studies looking at ways to reduce vaccine stockouts have been limited. We causally evaluated the effect of Vaccine Direct Delivery (VDD), an intervention to ensure the vaccine stock availability at health facilities, on the reduction of stockouts in Bauchi state, Nigeria. METHODS: Employing the interrupted time-series method, we evaluated the change in the occurrence of vaccine stockouts before and after the introduction of VDD in July 2015. We used health facility level data from January 2013 to December 2018 among 175 facilities in Bauchi state, collected through the District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2) for monthly information on stockouts and stock balances in all the health facilities in Nigeria. Data were analyzed using Stata 15 SE. To validate the causal relationship between VDD and vaccine stockouts, we conducted two sets of robustness checks. First, we evaluated the effect of VDD on the stockouts of other commodities. Second, we compared the trend of the prevalence of vaccine stockouts among health facilities between Bauchi state where VDD was introduced and another state (Adamawa state) where VDD was never introduced. RESULTS: After the introduction of VDD, vaccine stockouts in Bauchi state decreased by 9 percentage points on average, and they have been decreasing monthly by 0.4 percentage points more than pre-VDD. In Adamawa state, where VDD was never introduced, the prevalence of vaccine stockouts did not change over time. In Bauchi state after VDD introduction, the stock balances of target vaccines all increased, and the number of vaccinations carried out increased in neighboring health facilities. CONCLUSIONS: VDD intervention resulted in a significant reduction of vaccine stockouts as well as in an increase in the number of vaccinations performed. However, we should consider how to improve the system to provide vaccination service to the population in a sustainable way.',\n",
       " 'A number of issues related to vaccines and vaccinations in society are discussed in this paper. Our purpose is to merge an analysis of some recent changes in the vaccine market with social science research on the relationship between citizens and authorities. The article has two empirical parts. The first shows how the vaccine market, which for many years has had immense financial problems, nowadays seems to becoming economically vitalized, mostly due to the production of new and profitable vaccines. However prosperous the future may appear, certain reactions from the public regarding vaccination initiatives offer insight into inherent problems of vaccine policies in many Western countries. In the second part of the article, these problems are exemplified with the recent controversy over the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine. We conclude that in spite of the improving profit-margins, the vaccine market remains vulnerable and insecure. Vaccines are permeated by society, even more so than pharmaceutics that are used to cure or alleviate illnesses. Radical changes in financial conditions with promises of a more profitable market will not, we argue, solve other even more fundamental problems.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: The widespread COVID-19 vaccination program, issued by the Israel Government, provides a unique opportunity to examine psychiatric morbidity and vaccine attitudes among individuals who have already been vaccinated. Accordingly, the current study examined how vaccine hesitancy contributes to clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic stress among individuals who had received COVID-19 vaccinations. METHODS: We analyzed data obtained from 254 vaccinated individuals, and assessed vaccine hesitancy, depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic distress, as well as several demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors. RESULTS: Logistic regressions demonstrated that above and beyond socio-demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was the most prominent risk factor for anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic distress. Higher levels of vaccine hesitancy were found to double the risk for depression and peritraumatic stress (ORs > 2), and to triple the risk for anxiety (OR > 3). LIMITATIONS: A cross-sectional design; a preliminary study requiring further investigation CONCLUSIONS: This study points to the importance of vaccine hesitancy among vaccinated populations and provides knowledge regarding its associations with negative psychiatric outcomes. These findings may offer important information for healthcare practitioners and policy makers in their attempt to encourage individuals to receive COVID-19 vaccinations and emphasize the need to further understand the underlying mechanisms of psychiatric morbidity among vaccinated individuals.',\n",
       " 'To compare antibody seroresponse and adverse vaccinal reaction induced by Newcastle disease (ND) vaccination after eye-nose drop or coarse spray, groups of SPF broiler hens were vaccinated at day 4 (day of hatch is day 0) and intratracheally inoculated with Escherichia coli at day 11. Body weight gain (BWG) was assessed between day 4 and day 18; colibacillosis lesions and serum antibodies were determined at day 18. Meaningful comparison requires similar vaccine uptake. Vaccine virus loss during spray relative to eye-nose drop, which was assessed by comparing the results of endpoint titrations, was 3 log(10). Colibacillosis lesions in birds spray vaccinated with 10(6.4) EID(50)/chicken were significantly more severe (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), compared to those in birds eye-nose drop vaccinated with 10(3.4) EID(50)/chicken, while the seroresponse was slightly but significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) stronger.

It is concluded that: (1) There is room to improve the coarse ND vaccine spray used regarding adverse vaccinal reaction, while maintaining a sufficient immune response. This is also applicable to the coarse ND powder vaccine studied in previous research, which induced similar antibody response and adverse vaccinal reaction as the spray vaccine used here. (2) The vaccine virus dose influences the colibacillosis susceptibility at seven days post vaccination, as the dynamics of the vaccine virus infection is likely dose-dependent. (3) Low vaccine virus doses likely result in heterogeneous vaccine-take followed by vaccine virus spread from vaccine shedding birds to their non-vaccine virus infected flock mates (\"rolling vaccinal reaction\").',\n",
       " 'Infants born prematurely (before completion of 37 weeks of gestation) are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to vaccine preventable diseases, mostly because of their immunological immaturity and failure of transfer of maternal protective antibodies. Despite their great need of being vaccinated, concerns on vaccine safety and efficacy, constitute the main reasons for which vaccinations are often delayed in this group. In this review we summarize the latest evidence on vaccine safety, efficacy and immunogenicity in preterm infants which is similar to full-term infants. Therefore there is no reason for delaying vaccination in this population.',\n",

       " \"BACKGROUND: In recent years, vaccine hesitancy among health professionals has emerged as an important issue on public health agendas. However, we do not yet know very much about whether, and if so how, trust in institutions affects their practices. METHODS: A path analysis model explaining the influence of trust on GPs' vaccine hesitancy was applied to a cross-sectional survey of 1,582 French GPs performed in 2014. We hypothesized that distrust in public health institutions influences GPs' concerns about the safety of various vaccines, their perceptions about the importance of vaccination, their self-efficacy in the doctor-patient relationship, and ultimately their vaccination recommendations to patients. RESULTS: GPs' trust in institutions was found to be significantly associated with lower vaccine hesitancy, an association mediated to a large extent by the vaccine's perceived safety (β\\xa0=\\xa00.09, P\\xa0<\\xa00.01) and the importance of vaccination (β\\xa0=\\xa00.46, P\\xa0<\\xa00.001). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that restoration of high vaccination coverage may require the re-establishment of a significant degree of trust in the public health system among health professionals.\",\n",
       " 'Evidence of vaccine efficacy is essential for practitioners when giving advice to clients about the relative merits of different vaccines or when trying to evaluate the economic benefits of instituting a vaccine program. In equine veterinary medicine, this sort of data, which are necessary to make informed decisions about vaccine use and effectiveness, are often not available. Veterinarians need to consider the epidemiology of the disease in question, the type of vaccine that they are administering to the animal, the immunologic constraints of the vaccine technology, and the available evidence of efficacy when they are evaluating which vaccine to use or whether to vaccinate at all.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Prior studies showed that live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is more effective than inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in children aged 2-8 years, supporting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations in 2014 for preferential LAIV use in this age group. However, 2014-2015 U.S. effectiveness data indicated relatively poor effectiveness of both vaccines, leading CDC in 2015 to no longer prefer LAIV. METHODS: An age-structured model of influenza transmission and vaccination was developed, which incorporated both direct and indirect protection induced by vaccination. Based on this model, the cost effectiveness of influenza vaccination strategies in children aged 2-8 years in the U.S. was estimated. The base case assumed a mixed vaccination strategy where 33.3% and 66.7% of vaccinated children aged 2-8 years receive LAIV and IIV, respectively. Analyses were performed in 2014-2015. RESULTS: Using published meta-analysis vaccine effectiveness data (83% LAIV and 64% IIV), exclusive LAIV use would be a cost-effective strategy when vaccinating children aged 2-8 years, whereas IIV would not be preferred. However, when 2014-2015 U.S. effectiveness data (0% LAIV and 15% IIV) were used, IIV was likely to be preferred. CONCLUSIONS: The cost effectiveness of influenza vaccination in children aged 2-8 years is highly dependent on vaccine effectiveness; the vaccine type with higher effectiveness is preferred. In general, exclusive IIV use is preferred over LAIV use, as long as vaccine effectiveness is higher for IIV than for LAIV.',\n",
       " \"High vaccine coverage rates were reached for hepatitis B vaccination in teenagers nearly two decades ago (1995), but controversy sharply decreased the rate of vaccination in France, requiring high remobilization in its favor and careful monitoring of vaccine coverage rates. We report the results of Vaccinoscopie(®) survey which has monitored the yearly evolution of vaccine coverage rates since 2008. METHOD: A representative national sample of 5250 mothers was recruited in 2011: 3000 mothers of infants (1000 for each of the following age range: 0-11 months, 12-23 months, and 24-35 months of age) and 2250 mothers of teenagers. They all answered a self-administered questionnaire on the Internet and reported all vaccinations included in their child's health record. RESULTS: In 2011, 82.4% (CI 95%: 77.6-87.1) of infants 6-8 months of age were given hepatitis B vaccination before six months of age and 71.9% (CI 95%: 66.3-77.5) of children 24-26 months of age were fully immunized before 24 months of age. France should reach its objectives for infants thanks to the hexavalent vaccine, but this is not the case for teenagers since in 2011, at 14-16 years of age, only 55.4% (CI 95%: 53.3-57.4) had started their vaccination schedule and 37.4% (CI 95%: 35.4-39.4) were fully vaccinated. CONCLUSION: This recent data, specially concerning teenagers, should lead to corrective measures rapidly to reach vaccine coverage targets for this vaccination.\",\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVE: Adolescent meningococcal vaccine uptake remains low. We examined vaccine awareness among parents of adolescents and uptake. METHODS: Parents of adolescents aged 11 to 17 years (n = 1281) participated in a statewide survey. Logistic regression with weighted data provided population-based estimates. RESULTS: In all, 65% had heard of meningococcal vaccine; parents more likely to report awareness had adolescents aged 16 to 17 years, in private school, or with health insurance. In total, 44% of aware parents reported vaccination; vaccinated teens were more likely to be black (odds ratio [OR] = 2.17), had a preventive checkup within 12 months (OR = 3.03), or resided with another child ≤18 years (OR = 1.83). Many parents of unvaccinated adolescents (38.5%) did not plan to vaccinate them within 12 months. The most common reasons for not vaccinating were providers not recommending it and believing adolescents did not need it. CONCLUSION: Many parents aware of meningococcal vaccine did not vaccinate their adolescents. Interventions that include increasing provider recommendation and annual visits may increase uptake.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Recently a large clinical trial showed that the use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) among immunocompetent individuals aged 65 years and over was safe and efficacious. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating immunocompetent 65 year olds with PCV13 vaccine in England. England is a country with universal childhood pneumococcal conjugate vaccination programme in place (7-valent (PCV7) since 2006 and PCV13 since 2010), as well as a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPV23) vaccination programme targeting clinical risk-groups and those ≥65 years. METHOD: A static cohort cost-effectiveness model was developed to follow a cohort of 65 year olds until death, which will be vaccinated in the autumn of 2016 with PCV13. Sensitivity analysis was performed to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The childhood vaccination programme with PCV7 has induced herd protection among older unvaccinated age groups, with a resultant low residual disease burden caused by PCV7 vaccine types. We show similar herd protection effects for the 6 additional serotypes included in PCV13, and project a new low post-introduction equilibrium of vaccine-type disease in 2018/19. Applying these incidence projections for both invasive disease and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and using recent measures of vaccine efficacy against these endpoints for ≥65 year olds, we estimate that vaccination of a cohort of immunocompetent 65 year olds with PCV13 would directly prevent 26 cases of IPD, 69 cases of CAP and 15 deaths. The associated cost-effectiveness ratio is £257,771 per QALY gained (using list price of £49.10 per dose and £7.51 administration costs) and is therefore considered not cost-effective. To obtain a cost-effective programme the price per dose would need to be negative. The results were sensitive to disease incidence, waning vaccine protection and case fatality rate; despite this, the overall conclusion was robust. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinating immunocompetent individuals aged ≥65 years with PCV13 is efficacious. However the absolute incidence of vaccine-type disease will likely become very low due to wider benefits of the childhood PCV13 vaccination programme, such that a specific PCV13 vaccination programme targeting the immunocompetent elderly would not be cost-effective.',\n",
       " 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients experience increased infectious disease-related morbidity and mortality, and vaccinations represent an important element in their care. However, vaccine immunogenicity can be affected by disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy, such that vaccine choice and timing can be clinically challenging. We review the indications, safety, and immunogenicity of vaccines in the setting of RA. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent recommendations highlight the use of influenza, pneumococcal, and shingles vaccines in RA patients. Studies suggest influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are underutilized, but well tolerated in RA patients and generally immunogenic during DMARD use with the exception of rituximab. Though data for other nonlive vaccines are more limited, hepatitis B virus and human papilloma virus vaccines also appear well tolerated and immunogenic in this population. Live vaccines for shingles and yellow fever remain contraindicated in some RA patients; however, limited data suggest they might be well tolerated in certain individuals. SUMMARY: The review updates rheumatologists on the optimal use and timing of routine vaccinations in the care of RA.',\n",

Vaccines require more complex handling and storage requirements due to increased temperature sensitivity and complicated immunization schedules. This urges adequate knowledge, attitude, and practice. This study assessed the knowledge, attitude, and practice of vaccinators and vaccine handlers' in public health facilities. METHODOLOGY: An institutional-based cross-sectional study design was used to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of 127 vaccinators and vaccine handlers in public health facilities of Oromia Special Zone, from September 1 to 30, 2019. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires and a structured observation checklist. Descriptive and inferential statistics were made using the statistical package for social sciences version 20. Variables with a p-value <0.05 were taken as statistically significant. RESULT: The response rate was (96.94%). Sixty-eight (53.5%; 95% CI: 46.5%, 61.4%), 58 (45.7%; 95% CI: 37.8%, 53.5%) and 62 (48.8%: 95% CI; 41.7%, 56.7%) vaccinators and vaccine handlers had satisfactory knowledge, positive attitude and good practice respectively. Receiving training on cold chain management had a statistically significant association with the level of knowledge on cold chain management (AOR = 3.04, 95% CI: 1.04-8.88). CONCLUSIONS: More than half of vaccinators and vaccine handlers had satisfactory knowledge, while below half of vaccinators and vaccine handlers had a positive attitude and good practice. The determinants of knowledge in cold chain management were receiving training on cold chain management. Providing regular technical support and on the job training on vaccine cold chain management will improve the knowledge, attitude, and practice of vaccinators and vaccine handlers.\",\n",
       " 'In fish, DNA vaccines have been shown to give very high protection in experimental facilities against a number of viral diseases, particularly diseases caused by rhabdoviruses. However, their efficacy in generating protection against other families of fish viral pathogens is less clear. One DNA vaccine is currently in use commercially in fish farms in Canada and the commercialisation of another was authorised in Europe in 2017. The mechanism of action of DNA vaccines, including the role of the innate immune responses induced shortly after DNA vaccination in the activation of the adaptive immunity providing longer term specific protection, is still not fully understood. In Europe the procedure for the commercialisation of a veterinary DNA vaccine requires the resolution of certain concerns particularly about safety for the host vaccinated fish, the consumer and the environment. Relating to consumer acceptance and particularly environmental safety, a key question is whether a DNA vaccinated fish is considered a Genetically Modified Organism (GMO). In the present opinion paper these key aspects relating to the mechanisms of action, and to the development and the use of DNA vaccines in farmed fish are reviewed and discussed.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: To assess practices for assessing vaccination status and stocking recommended vaccines, barriers to vaccination, characteristics associated with reporting financial barriers to delivering vaccines, and practices regarding vaccination by alternate vaccinators. DESIGN: Mail and Internet-based survey. SETTING: Survey conducted from March to June 2012. PARTICIPANTS: General internists and family physicians throughout the United States. MEASUREMENTS: A financial barriers scale was created. Multivariable linear modeling for each specialty was performed to assess associations between a financial barrier score and physician and practice characteristics. RESULTS: Response rates were 79% (352 of 443) for general internists and 62% (255 of 409) for family physicians. Twenty-nine percent of general internists and 32% of family physicians reported assessing vaccination status at every visit. A minority used immunization information systems (8% and 36%, respectively). Almost all respondents reported assessing need for and stocking seasonal influenza; pneumococcal; tetanus and diphtheria; and tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccines. However, fewer assessed and stocked other recommended vaccines. The most commonly reported barriers were financial. Characteristics significantly associated with reporting greater financial barriers included private practice setting, fewer than 5 providers in the practice, and, for general internists only, having more patients with Medicare Part D. The most commonly reported reasons for referring patients elsewhere included lack of insurance coverage for the vaccine (55% for general internists and 62% for family physicians) or inadequate reimbursement (36% and 41%, respectively). Patients were most often referred to pharmacies/retail stores and public health departments. LIMITATIONS: Surveyed physicians may not be representative of all physicians. CONCLUSION: Improving adult vaccination delivery will require increased use of evidence-based methods for vaccination delivery and concerted efforts to resolve financial barriers, especially for smaller practices and for general internists who see more patients with Medicare Part D.

       " \"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the potential public health impact of the live attenuated tetravalent Sanofi Pasteur dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) we analyzed data from the reported clinical trials to calculate vaccine preventable disease incidence (VPDI) and number needed to vaccinate (NNV) based on the licensure indication for persons age 9 years and above. METHODS: VPDI is defined as incidence in an unvaccinated population X vaccine efficacy (VE), and thus incorporates both VE and the underlying burden of disease. NNV was calculated as 100,000 divided by VPDI divided by 2-year length of study. We compared these values to data for three newer vaccines that are currently integrated into some national immunization programs in Asia and Latin America, namely pneumococcal conjugate, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and rotavirus vaccines. RESULTS: In the Asian-Pacific trial, in the first 25 months after the first dose of the dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV prevented annually 2639 cases of virologically confirmed dengue for every 100,000 persons vaccinated, for an NNV of 18. In the Latin American trial, given the overall lower annual dengue incidence compared to Asia, VPDI was 1707, and NNV 28. For the Asian-Pacific and Latin American studies, the VPDIs for hospitalized virologically confirmed disease at the trials' end were 638 and 239 per 100,000 population per year, respectively, with NNVs of 75 and 201. VPDI for confirmed dengue hospitalization was higher than that for Hib vaccine against Hib meningitis or all cause severe pneumonia while lower than that for rotavirus vaccine against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis found that the CYD-TDV dengue vaccine had favorable VPDI and NNV, also when compared to existing vaccines used in Latin America and Asia. VPDI and NNV varied by serotype distribution, extent of prior dengue exposure (baseline seroprevalence) and country. These findings will help policy-makers decide where and how to introduce this vaccine post-licensure.\",\n",
       " \"OBJECTIVES: To explain vaccine confidence as it related to parents' decisions to vaccinate their children with recommended vaccines, and to develop a confidence measure to efficiently and effectively predict parents' self-reported vaccine behaviors. METHOD: A sample of parents with at least one child younger than 6 years (n = 376) was analyzed using data from the HealthStyles 2010 survey. Questions were grouped into block variables to create three confidence constructs: value, safety, and efficacy. Regression equations controlling for demographic characteristics were used to identify the confidence construct(s) that best predicted parents' self-reported vaccination decisions (accept all, some, or none of the recommended childhood vaccines). RESULTS: Among the three constructs evaluated, confidence in the value of vaccines, that is the belief that vaccines are important and vaccinating one's children is the right thing to do, was the best predictor of parents' vaccine decisions, F(2, 351) = 119.199, p < .001. When combined into a block variable for analysis, two survey items measuring confidence in the value of vaccines accounted for 40% of the variance in parents' self-reported vaccine decisions. Confidence in the safety or efficacy of vaccines failed to account for additional significant variance in parent-reported vaccination behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Confidence in the value of vaccines is a helpful predictor of parent-reported vaccination behavior. Attitudinal constructs of confidence in the safety and efficacy of vaccines failed to account for additional significant variance in parents' vaccination behaviors. Future research should assess the role of vaccine knowledge and tangible barriers, such as access and cost, to further explain parents' vaccination behaviors.\",\n",

       " \"OBJECTIVES: Parents who have concerns about vaccine safety may be reluctant to have their children vaccinated. The purpose of this study was to explore how vaccination coverage among children 19 to 35 months of age is associated with health care providers' influence on parents' decision to vaccinate their children, and with parents' beliefs about vaccine safety. METHODS: Parents of 7695 children 19 to 35 months of age sampled by the National Immunization Survey were administered the National Immunization Survey Parental Knowledge Module between the third quarter of 2001 and the fourth quarter of 2002. Health care providers were defined as a physician, nurse, or any other type of health care professional. Parents provided responses that summarized the degree to which they believed vaccines were safe, and the influence providers had on their decisions to vaccinate their children. Children were determined to be up-to-date if their vaccination providers reported administering > or = 4 doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine, > or = 3 doses of polio vaccine, > or = 1 dose of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, > or = 3 doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, and > or = 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine. RESULTS: Of all of the parents, 5.7% thought that vaccines were not safe, and 21.5% said that their decision to vaccinate their children was not influenced by a health care provider. Compared with parents who responded that providers were not influential in their decision to vaccinate their children, parents who responded that providers were influential were twice as likely to respond that vaccines were safe for children. Among children whose parents believed that vaccines were not safe, those whose parents' decision to vaccinate was influenced by a health care provider had an estimated vaccination coverage rate that was significantly higher than the estimated coverage rate among children whose parents' decision was not influenced by a health care provider (74.4% vs 50.3%; estimated difference: 24.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Health care providers have a positive influence on parents to vaccinate their children, including parents who believe that vaccinations are unsafe. Physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals should increase their efforts to build honest and respectful relationships with parents, especially when parents express concerns about vaccine safety or have misconceptions about the benefits and risks of vaccinations.\",\n",
       " 'Vaccines against COVID-19 are likely to be approved for children under 12 years in the near future. Understanding vaccine hesitancy in parents is essential for reaching herd immunity. A cross-sectional survey of caregivers in 12 emergency departments (ED) was undertaken in the U.S., Canada, and Israel. We compared reported willingness to vaccinate children against COVID-19 with an initial survey and post-adult COVID-19 vaccine approval. Multivariable logistic regression models were performed for all children and for those <12 years. A total of 1728 and 1041 surveys were completed in phases 1 and 2, respectively. Fewer caregivers planned to vaccinate against COVID-19 in phase 2 (64.5% and 59.7%, respectively; p = 0.002). The most significant positive predictor of willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 was if the child was vaccinated per recommended local schedules. Fewer caregivers plan to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, despite vaccine approval for adults, compared to what was reported at the peak of the pandemic. Older caregivers who fully vaccinated their children were more likely to adopt vaccinating children. This study can inform target strategy design to implement adherence to a vaccination campaign.',\n",
       " 'Maternal immunization for prevention of morbidity and mortality of pregnant women and their neonates due to infectious diseases is ongoing worldwide. The complexity of vaccine research and development in this population is challenging. Not only do vaccines for pregnant women require evidence of immunogenicity, potency, stability, and limited reactogenicity, they must also provide efficacy in decreasing morbidity for the pregnant woman, her fetus, and the neonate, demonstrate safety or lack of evidence of harm, and offer benefit or potential benefit of vaccination during pregnancy. Since the 19th century, evidence of protective effects of vaccination during pregnancy has been documented. Pandemic influenza and pertussis outbreaks in recent years have affected a paradigm shift in vaccine research and development as well as current policy regarding immunization in pregnancy. Studies of the immune system in pregnant women and neonates have shown that immune changes associated with pregnancy in women do not interfere with maternal vaccine responses, multiple factors are important in transplacental transfer of antibodies, and maternal antibodies are beneficial to neonates. In recent years, guidelines have been developed by expert panels to help design studies for maternal vaccinations and for harmonization of data collection, analysis, and adverse event reporting. Further research into maternal and neonatal immunology, transplacental antibody transfer, and epidemiology of diseases is needed, especially as new vaccines to respiratory syncytial virus, cytomegalovirus, and Group B streptococcus are developed. Maternal vaccinations have the potential to change the epidemiology of infectious diseases in reproductive health and pediatrics and may lead to new clinical applications to improve global maternal and neonatal health.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Reimbursement of the hexavalent vaccine (Infanrix hexa) comprising the DTPa-IPV-Hib components and the hepatitis B valence in a single vaccine was decided in March 2008 in France. The impact of its reimbursement on the hepatitis B vaccine coverage rate was assessed in a study conducted in the general population prior to and after implementation of the reimbursement policy. METHODS: The PopCorn study (NCT01782794) was a national, cross-sectional and repeated study, with four assessment periods over 3 years, from 2009 to 2012, to assess the hepatitis B vaccine coverage in 12- to 15- and 24- to 27-month-old children, vaccinated between 2007 and 2011 and selected by the quota sampling method. Face-to-face interviews were conducted at their homes and vaccination status was collected using their child\\'s health record. Parents were also interviewed on their perceptions and acceptance of hepatitis B vaccination. Three indicators were calculated to assess hepatitis B vaccination coverage: proportions of infants with at least one dose before 6 months of age, with at least two doses before 6 months of age and with a complete schedule at 24 months of age. RESULTS: A total of 4903 children were enrolled in the study. An overall significant increase (P-value [P<0.05]) of the three indicators of interest over the four periods of time was observed for both age groups. The proportion of children receiving hepatitis B vaccination before 6 months increased from 21% at baseline (before vaccine reimbursement) to almost 75% at the last assessment period in 2012. More than 60% of 24- to 27-month-old children received a complete schedule in 2012 compared to 33% at baseline. No significant increases in the proportions of parents \"favourable\" and \"moderately in favour\" of hepatitis B vaccination were observed across the four evaluation periods (respectively, 17-22% and 48-50%, P=0.09). CONCLUSION: The rapid increase of hepatitis B vaccination coverage suggests a significant change in hepatitis B vaccination practice related to the hexavalent vaccine\\'s reimbursement. This change was observed in a context of stability regarding parents\\' perceptions and acceptance of hepatitis B vaccination and of coverage rates for other infant vaccinations.',\n",
       " \"Despite a well documented efficacy and a generally good adhesion of a large majority of the lay population and health care professionals as well, immunization is still the object of controversies. It affects several vaccines against hepatitis B, influenza, BCG, pertussis and measles. In most cases, polemics on vaccination result from a temporal association between a vaccination and the revelation of a serious disease, when the immunization is performed at the peak of incidence of the disease. Controversies can also be initiated by scientific publications, even though these are often biased, by a misinterpretation or the absence of official positions from the health care authorities, or by justice decisions, whose criteria differ from the scientists' ones and are therefore difficult to understand for the lay public. Furthermore, the scientific demonstration of the exclusion of a risk is difficult to obtain. In the past, it appeared to be very difficult to stop controversies. Improving the communication is the main issue, towards lay public as well as health care professionals. This implies to learn how to better use the media, to motivate and educate professionals who administer vaccine, and anticipate the eventuality of a temporal relationship between vaccination and occurrence of a serious disease by an improved management of the pharmacovigilance system.\",\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: In 2016 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended against using the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) for the 2016-2017 influenza season. This recommendation is potentially important for vaccination rates because perceived effectiveness and ease of administration are among the primary determinants of families decisions to vaccinate their children. This investigation sought to determine whether rates of pediatric influenza vaccination changed in a season when the LAIV was not recommended. METHODS: This study used cohort and cross sectional data from an academic primary care pediatric center in central Pennsylvania that serves approximately 12,500 patients. Early season (prior to November 1) and end-of-season (prior to March 1) vaccination rates in the 2015-16 and 2016-17 influenza seasons were recorded for individuals 2-17years old. Repeat vaccination rates (percentage of children receiving influenza vaccination in one season who were also vaccinated in the next season) were recorded for the 2015-16 into 2016-17 seasons. A logistic regression model adjusting for race, ethnicity, age, insurance type and type of vaccination received was employed to identify predictors of repeat vaccination. RESULTS: In the absence of LAIV (2016-17) early vaccination rates were significantly higher (24.7% vs 22.8%, p=0.004), but end-of-season rates were lower (50.4% vs 52.0%, p=0.03) than when LAIV was offered (2015-16). After adjusting for covariates, those who had received IIV in the 2015-16 season had higher odds (OR 1.32, 95% CI, 1.15-1.52) of getting a repeat vaccination in the 2016-17 season, compared with those who had received LAIV in the 2015-16 season. CONCLUSIONS: End-of-season vaccination rates were lower in 2016-17 when LAIV was not recommended, particularly among children who received LAIV in the preceding year.

The future of vaccination depends on the continued health of this ecosystem and its ability to produce, purchase, deliver, and innovate. However, the number of vaccine producers that also do significant research and development has decreased over the last several years. Many of these R&D-based producers have been forced to cease production of critical vaccines, despite global shortages, so that in several cases only one or two producers remain. We discuss the reasons for these changes and what might be done to maintain a healthy vaccination ecosystem.',\n",
       " 'Vaccination strategies for adults have recently been updated to include newer vaccine products and to reflect the changing epidemiology of vaccine-preventable diseases in adults. New products include vaccines against shingles and the human papillomavirus, and a combination vaccine which contains an acellular pertussis component (Tdap). In some cases, existing vaccines have been re-formulated to provide alternate routes of delivery, as is the case with the influenza vaccine, or more effective formulations, as is the case with the meningococcal vaccine. Vaccine strategies for adults are designed to respond to existing, emerging, or re-emerging infectious diseases in populations at risk. This includes the resurgence of pertussis and recent evidence showing that diabetics are at increased risk for hepatitis B. Unfortunately, large portions of the adult population do not receive recommended vaccinations. As a result, more adults die from vaccine-preventable diseases than die from motor vehicle accidents. Strategies to improve vaccine coverage include public education campaigns and making some vaccines available in nontraditional settings such as retail stores or workplaces. Within health care settings, successful strategies have included the use of standing orders, automatic reminders for physicians using the electronic health record and recall/reminder letters for patients. Appropriate use of adult vaccines plays a key role in prevention of disease and the provision of high-quality care.',\n",
       " 'The following summarizes this author\\'s current thoughts regarding veterinary vaccines and their safety: 1. Every licensed animal vaccine is probably effective, but also produces some adverse effects. 2. Prelicensing studies of vaccines are not specifically designed to detect adverse vaccine reactions. 3. An improved system of national postmarketing surveillance is required to identify most adverse vaccine reactions that occur at low and moderate frequency. 4. Even a good postmarketing surveillance system is unlikely, however, to detect delayed adverse vaccine reactions, and the longer the delay the less likely they will be associated with vaccination. 5. Analytic epidemiologic (field) studies are the best way to link vaccination with delayed adverse reactions, but these are often hindered by incomplete vaccination histories in medical records in veterinary practice and by a lack of veterinarians in industry trained in epidemiologic methods. 6. Each licensed veterinary vaccine should be subjected to a quantitative risk assessment, and these should be updated on a regular basis as new information becomes available. 7. Risk assessment should be used to identify gaps in information regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccines, and appropriate epidemiologic studies conducted to fill these gaps that contribute to the uncertainty in risk estimates. 8. Risk assessment is an analytical process that is firmly based on scientific considerations, but it also requires judgments to be made when the available information is incomplete. These judgments inevitably draw on both scientific and policy considerations. 9. Representatives from industry, government, veterinary medicine, and the animal-owning public should be involved in risk management, that is, deciding between policy options. The controversy regarding vaccine risks is intensifying to the point that some animal owners have stopped vaccinating their animals. They offer as justification the belief that current vaccines are \"just too dangerous.\" Some owners report that since they completely stopped vaccinating their animals, they have been healthy. What they fail to realize is that a high percentage of animal owners are responsible and do vaccinate their animals, thus providing \"herd immunity\" protection to the unvaccinated animals whom they contact. The solution to the vaccine controversy is not to abandon vaccination as an effective means of disease prevention and control, but rather to encourage vaccine research to answer important questions regarding safety and to identify the biological basis for adverse reactions. Key questions to be answered include these: What components of vaccines are responsible for adverse reactions? What is the genetic basis for susceptibility to adverse health effects in animals? How can susceptible individuals be identified? Do multivalent vaccines cause a higher rate of adverse reactions than monovalent vaccines? Is administration of multiple doses of monovalent vaccines really any safer than administering a single multivalent vaccine? These and other vaccine-related questions deserve our attention as veterinarians so we can fulfill our veterinary oath to relieve animal suffering and \"above all else, do no harm.\"',\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the ability of a high-cell-passage canine coronavirus vaccine to immunise dogs against challenge with a field isolate of the virus. METHODS: Three dogs that had previously tested seronegative and virus-negative for canine coronavirus were inoculated twice, at 21-day intervals, with the vaccine and kept under observation. Two seronegative and virus-negative dogs served as unvaccinated controls. For safety tests, two additional dogs were inoculated oronasally with 10 times the vaccinal dose and no reactions were observed. Faecal samples were collected daily from the vaccinated dogs after the first and second inoculations. Both vaccinated and control dogs were challenged two weeks after the second vaccination with a field canine coronavirus strain. Blood samples were collected for serological tests before vaccination and at weekly intervals after vaccinations and challenge. RESULTS: Virus was not detected in faecal samples after the first or second vaccinations by virus isolation assays and PCR. Significantly, the vaccinated dogs did not have clinical signs after challenge and no virus shedding was observed. The two unvaccinated control dogs had moderate enteritis, and virus was detected in cell cultures starting from three days postchallenge (dog 1) and two days postchallenge (dog 2), and by PCR for 23 median days. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study showed the efficacy of a high-cell-passage canine coronavirus vaccine in preventing infection of dogs by virulent virus and, specifically, its ability to induce sterilising immunity.',\n",

In Tuscany, educational courses on VPID in high schools were organized and students were stimulated to prepare informative materials on VPID for lower grade school pupils. In Liguria, an educational card game (named 'Vaccine at the Fair') was presented to children of primary schools.

Therefore, we have compared different schedules for the combined use of a live IBR marker vaccine and an inactivated BVD vaccine. The neutralizing antibody response against BVDV did not reveal any differences between the group vaccinated only with the BVD vaccine and the groups that were vaccinated simultaneously (together in the same syringe) or concurrently (two separate injections) with the IBR marker vaccine at the first or second dose and the third dose of the BVD vaccine. Likewise, the bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) neutralizing antibody titres did not exhibit any negative effect by the simultaneous or concurrent use of the two products as compared to the single IBR marker vaccination. These results indicate that the two vaccines can be applied at the same day for the first or second dose of the BVD basic vaccination and then at the booster vaccinations (third dose onwards).',\n",

In order to address this issue, additional community immunizers are needed, and pharmacists are in an ideal position to fill this void. OBJECTIVES: To explore issues and barriers related to implementation of a pharmacy-based adult vaccine benefit and develop recommendations supporting a pathway for benefit expansion. METHODS: A literature review on the current environment surrounding pharmacy-based adult vaccinations and structured interviews were conducted to inform an expert panel meeting using a modified Delphi process (pre/post survey). The goal was to develop recommendations on how to improve access to adult vaccines. RESULTS: Findings suggest employers play a key role in requesting changes in benefit design to include pharmacy-based vaccinations. However, the lack of consistent communication between pharmacists and primary care providers remains a significant barrier. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacy-based access to vaccinations improves patient access and benefits individuals and employers. In order to take advantage of this opportunity, pharmacists must be viewed within the broader context of preventative care, including pharmacy-based vaccinations.',\n",

The meeting is a continuation of a solution-oriented vaccine financing dialogue held in February 2007 at the 1st Immunization Congress. The need for this forum arose from concerns that increased costs of immunization could hinder the ability of current financing and delivery systems to maintain access without financial barriers. Preventive care and additional financial coverage for vaccines are key points in federal health reform but some populations, especially adolescents and adults, could continue to experience challenges in accessing vaccines. Congress participants discussed adequate reimbursement in the public and private sectors for vaccine delivery and the potential financial resources, data, and infrastructure needed to increase vaccine uptake in the US.

       " 'Rabies prevention in travelers is a controversial issue. According to experts, the decision to vaccinate results from an individual risk assessment based on the duration of stay, the likelihood of engagement in at-risk activities, the age of the traveler, the rabies endemicity and access to appropriate medical care in the country of destination. However, no detailed information is available regarding the last two determinants in many regions. Twenty-two cases of rabies were reported in tourists, expatriates and migrant travelers over the last decade, including three cases following short-term travel of no more than two weeks. Studies on rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in travelers show that overall, 0.4% (range 0.01-2.3%) of travelers have experienced an at-risk bite per month of stay in a rabies-endemic country, while 31% of expatriates and 12% of tourists were vaccinated against rabies before traveling. The main reason cited by travelers for not being vaccinated is the cost of the vaccine. The majority of patients who sustained a high risk injury was not vaccinated against rabies before traveling and were not properly treated abroad. From available studies, the following risk factors for injuries sustained from potentially rabid animals may be identified: traveling to South-East Asia, India or North Africa, young age, and traveling for tourism. The duration of travel does not appear to be a risk factor. It should be noted that \"at-risk activities\" have not been addressed in these studies. Detailed rabies distribution maps and information on the availability of rabies biologics are urgently needed in order to identify those travelers who need pre-travel vaccination. Meanwhile, cost-minimization of rabies pre-exposure vaccination may be achieved in several ways, notably by using the intra-dermal method of vaccination.',\n",

But it must go beyond this, and aim to protect all populations and control diseases, even eradicate them where possible. New vaccine strategies must be developed taking into account the epidemiology of diseases and the inherent logistic problems of implementing these strategies under local conditions. There are three major thrusts to the progress of the discipline. The improvement of the vaccines available. One of the drives of vaccinology is not only to deliver vaccines of increasing safety (replacement of the current vaccine for whooping cough with an acellular vaccine for example), but also to improve vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity (in particular for flu, tuberculosis, cholera and rabies vaccines). The optimisation of vaccination programmes and strategies for vaccinations. The ideal is to protect against the greatest possible number of diseases with the smallest number of vaccinations. The development of combinations of vaccines is central to this goal. The objective for the year 2000 is a hexavalent vaccine DTPP Hib HB. The development of new vaccines.

Such infections have often a sudden onset and a fulminant course. Infectious diseases (IDs) incidence in AH subjects can be reduced by preventive measures such as vaccination. The aim of our work is to provide updated recommendations on prevention of infectious diseases in AH adult patients, and to supply a useful and practical tool to healthcare workers for the management of these subjects, in hospital setting and in outpatients consultation. A systematic literature review on evidence based measures for the prevention of IDs in adult AH patients was performed in 2015. Updated recommendations on available vaccines were consequently provided. Vaccinations against S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, H. influenzae type b and influenza virus are strongly recommended and should be administered at least 2\\xa0weeks before surgery in elective cases or at least 2\\xa0weeks after the surgical intervention in emergency cases. In subjects without evidence of immunity, 2 doses of live attenuated vaccines against measles-mumps-rubella and varicella should be administered 4-8\\xa0weeks apart from each other; a booster dose of tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccine should be administered also to subjects fully vaccinated, and a 3-dose primary vaccination series is recommended in AH subjects with unknown or incomplete vaccination series (as in healthy people).

       " 'This review examines four events related to vaccination that have occurred in recent years: (a) the ongoing recovery from the MMR/Autism scare in the UK, (b) the upgrading of the Varicella vaccine to a universal childhood vaccine, (c) the major effort of authorities to provide a vaccine for A/H1N1 influenza and its rejection by the public, and, d) the current attempts to change the HPV vaccine target from girls only to boys and girls. All of these changes have been met with shifts in the public acceptance of the relevant vaccine. These shifts are characterized not only by the number of people willing to be vaccinated, but also by the attitudes and the motives related to acceptance. Examination of the interrelationship between changes in vaccination realities, and changes in acceptance patterns suggests that today, the public has a better understanding of vaccination, is acting in a more reflexive way, and is capable of changing attitudes and behavior. All together, changes in vaccination enhance debates and dialogues about vaccines, and lead to higher awareness and more conscious acceptance.',\n",
       " \"Flu Avert IN vaccine is a new, live attenuated virus vaccine for equine influenza. We tested this vaccine in vivo to ascertain 1) its safety and stability when subjected to serial horse to horse passage, 2) whether it spread spontaneously from horse to horse and 3) its ability to protect against heterologous equine influenza challenge viruses of epidemiological relevance. For the stability study, the vaccine was administered to 5 ponies. Nasal swabs were collected and pooled fluids administered directly to 4 successive groups of naïve ponies by intranasal inoculation. Viruses isolated from the last group retained the vaccine's full attenuation phenotype, with no reversion to the wild-type virus phenotype or production of clinical influenza disease. The vaccine virus spread spontaneously to only 1 of 13 nonvaccinated horses/ponies when these were comingled with 39 vaccinates in the same field. For the heterologous protection study, a challenge model system was utilised in which vaccinated or naïve control horses and ponies were exposed to the challenge virus by inhalation of virus-containing aerosols. Challenge viruses included influenza A/equine-2/Kentucky/98, a recent representative of the 'American' lineage of equine-2 influenza viruses; and A/equine-2/Saskatoon/90, representative of the 'Eurasian' lineage. Clinical signs among challenged animals were recorded daily using a standardised scoring protocol. With both challenge viruses, control animals reliably contracted clinical signs of influenza, whereas vaccinated animals were reliably protected from clinical disease. These results demonstrate that Flu Avert IN vaccine is safe and phenotypically stable, has low spontaneous transmissibility and is effective in protecting horses against challenge viruses representative of those in circulation worldwide.\",\n",

Community pharmacies are well positioned to help fill this gap through easy access and innovative patient-centered interventions. The primary goal of this demonstration project was to implement new notification and motivational interviewing processes at a regional supermarket chain pharmacy to increase the number of influenza, pertussis, pneumococcal, and herpes zoster vaccines provided to adults. METHODS: This prospective, observational project utilized a pre-post design. Algorithms were developed with pharmacy dispensing data to identify vaccine-eligible patients. Pharmacy staff then received automated notifications through one of the following: (1) a vaccine message printed on the prescription receipt or on paper attached to the prescription bag when patients came to the pharmacy; or (2) a patient list generated through commercially-available software listing patient contact information and which vaccine they were eligible to receive. Irrespective of the notification process, pharmacy staff employed motivational interviewing techniques either face-to-face or telephonic to engage patients in conversation about getting vaccinated. Finally, an interface to the statewide vaccination registry was developed and tested to transmit vaccination information from all pharmacy locations. RESULTS: Ninety-nine pharmacies participated in the demonstration project across western Pennsylvania. A 33% increase in vaccinations was recorded over the prior year. Increases in vaccines were demonstrated in three of the four vaccine types: 45% for influenza, 31% for pertussis, and 7% for pneumococcal vaccinations. A decrease of 5% was observed for herpes zoster vaccinations. A successful connection to the statewide vaccine registry was established and 100% of all vaccines administered were transmitted to the registry. CONCLUSION: A combination of face-to-face and telephonic interventions with motivational interviewing were successful at increasing adult vaccinations in a regional supermarket chain pharmacy. Equal and sustained prioritization for all vaccines is necessary to achieve increases across all vaccine types.',\n",

       " 'PURPOSE: We studied the influence of oncology and primary care provider (PCP) recommendations on caregiver intentions to restart vaccines (e.g., catch-up or boosters) after cancer treatment. METHODS: We surveyed primary caregivers ages 18 or older with a child who had completed cancer treatment 3-36 months prior (N = 145) about demographics, child\\'s vaccination status, and healthcare factors (e.g., provider recommendations, barriers, preferences for vaccination). We compared these factors by caregiver\\'s intention to restart vaccines (\"vaccine intention\" vs. \"no intent to vaccinate\") using bivariate and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: Caregivers were primarily ages 30-39 years (54.9%), mothers (80.6%), college graduates (44.4%), non-Hispanic (89.2%), and married (88.2%). Overall, 34.5% of caregivers did not know which vaccines their child needed. However, 65.5% of caregivers reported vaccine intention. Fewer caregivers with no intention to vaccinate believed that vaccinating their child helps protect others (85.4 vs. 99.0%, p < 0.01), that vaccines are needed when diseases are rare (83.7 vs. 100.0%, p < 0.01), and that vaccines are safe (80.4 vs. 92.6%, p = 0.03) and effective (91.5 vs. 98.9%, p = 0.04) compared with vaccine intention caregivers, respectively. Provider recommendations increased caregivers\\' likelihood of vaccine intention (oncologist RR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.27-2.12, p < 0.01; PCP RR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.19-1.94, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Provider recommendations positively influence caregivers\\' intention to restart vaccines after childhood cancer. Guidelines are needed to support providers in making tailored vaccine recommendations. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Timely vaccination after childhood cancer protects patients against vaccine-preventable diseases during survivorship. Caregivers may benefit from discussing restarting vaccinations after cancer with healthcare providers.',\n",

Vaccines are usually administered according to standard vaccination schedules, which have been established on historical grounds. We argue and demonstrate with examples (meningococci C, Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococci and Bordetella pertussis) that adaptation of these standard vaccination schedules can be cost-saving and lead to better protection.

Diva (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals; also termed marker) vaccines and companion diagnostic tests have been developed that can be used for progammes aimed to control or eradicate virus infections. Vaccine-induced herd immunity, which can be measured relatively easily when diva vaccines are used, is a crucial issue in such programmes. Current vaccine research follows many routes towards novel vaccines, which can be divided into non-replicating ('killed') and replicating ('live') vaccines. Promising trends are the development of DNA vaccination, vector vaccines, and attenuation of DNA and RNA viruses by DNA technology. The lack of (in vitro) correlates of vaccine protection markedly hampers progress in vaccine research. Various characteristics of an 'ideal' vaccine are listed, such as multivalency and the induction of lifelong immunity after one non-invasive administration in animals with maternal immunity. Future research should be aimed at developing vaccines that approach the ideal as closely as possible and which are directed against diseases not yet controlled by vaccination and against newly emerging diseases.\",\n",
       " \"INTRODUCTION: The number of new vaccine introductions (NVIs) in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) has markedly increased since 2010, raising challenges to often overstretched and underfunded health\\xa0care systems. AREAS COVERED: We present an overview of some of these challenges, focusing on programmatic decisions, delivery strategy, information and communication, pharmacovigilance and post-licensure evaluation. We also highlight field-based initiatives that may facilitate NVI. EXPERT COMMENTARY: Some new vaccines targeting populations other than infants require alternative delivery strategies. NVIs impact upon existing supply chain management, in particular vaccines with novel characteristics. A lack of understanding about immunization and misconceptions may be detrimental to NVI, as well as insufficient or poorly trained health\\xa0care workforce. Many barriers exist to achieving good vaccination coverage. Real-world evaluation of vaccine safety, effectiveness and impact in LMICs may be limited by lack of robust demographic and disease epidemiology data, as well as limited health\\xa0care and surveillance infrastructure. A thorough planning phase is crucial to define the most suitable delivery strategy based on the vaccine's and country's specificities. A communication plan and social mobilization are essential. Implementation research and innovative approaches applied to logistics, delivery, communication and program evaluation can facilitate NVI.\",\n",
       " 'Pregnant women are a WHO priority group for influenza vaccination, but evidence from observational studies in pregnancy is subject, among others, to the healthy-vaccinee bias, overestimating the vaccine effectiveness and safety. An USA survey adds new evidence that documents this bias. Therefore, it is essential to assess vaccine effectiveness and safety with RCTs. Cochrane reviews identified one RCT with \"low risk of bias\", in a medium-income country, with NNV 55 for mothers. Its data show an excess of local adverse effects, and a tendency to harm for serious adverse events, with uncertain or very limited protection against influenza. A subsequent larger trial in a very-low-income African country found an excess of infant serious infections plus deaths in the influenza vaccine group. Also an available previous small trial and a subsequent large one in Asian low-income countries showed in tendency more deaths in the offspring vaccine groups. Before promoting seasonal influenza vaccinations during all pregnancies, more independent trials are needed, with appropriate designs and comparators. Meanwhile, vaccination in second-third trimester could be offered communicating the uncertainties and promoting informed choices, without neglecting to promote other protective behaviors.',\n",
       " 'The extent of dissemination of 17D yellow fever vaccine among the population of Kenya, especially among Africans, is estimated, largely from information in the records of the Kenya Medical Department. The total recorded vaccinations of Africans between 1941 and 1951 amount to about 379,000, representing 7.2% of the African population in 1948; it is, however, possible that the actual number of vaccinations is considerably higher. At Mombasa, 78,000 persons of races other than Africans were given routine inoculation over the same period.After a study of the economy of use of vaccine, the author discusses the protection-test surveys performed before 1951 and during that year in relation to the dissemination of vaccine. It is tentatively concluded that natural infection of man with yellow fever is rare in both Kenya and Tanganyika.',\n",
       " 'In February this year, about 100 delegates gathered for three days in Vienna (Austria) for the Next Generation Vaccines conference. The meeting held in the Vienna Hilton Hotel from 23rd-25th February 2011 had a strong focus on biotech and industry. The conference organizer Jacob Fleming managed to put together a versatile program ranging from the future generation of vaccines to manufacturing, vaccine distribution and delivery, to regulatory and public health issues. Carefully selected top industry experts presented first-hand experience and shared solutions for overcoming the latest challenges in the field of vaccinology. The program also included several case study presentations on novel vaccine candidates in different stages of development. An interactive pre-conference workshop as well as interactive panel discussions during the meeting allowed all delegates to gain new knowledge and become involved in lively discussions on timely, interesting and sometimes controversial topics related to vaccines.',\n",
       " \"A trial was carried out in 1-day-old broiler chicks raised for 54 days in floorpens under simulated commercial conditions, but isolated from all extraneous virulent coccidial infections, to demonstrate the safety of 'Paracox' attenuated vaccine administered at the recommended dose when chicks were 7 days old. The vaccine did not adversely affect the water consumption, faecal moisture or litter condition of the broilers. Recycling of the attenuated coccidia occurred in vaccinated birds, oocysts being present in the litter between 5 and 33 days after vaccination; a single peak of oocysts was detectable 5 or 12 days after vaccination. Unvaccinated medicated control birds did not produce oocysts, indicating freedom from both between-pen contamination by the vaccine and invasion of the chicken-house by extraneous coccidial infection. A small proportion (4%) of vaccinated birds had mild coccidial lesions when sampled at 26, 33 or 40 days after vaccination. Despite this, the vaccinated birds performed better than control (unvaccinated, nicarbazin-treated) birds and there was no post-vaccinal check in their weight gain. Their mean finishing weight was 10.4% greater, their food conversion ratio 7.2% lower and their mortality 44.4% lower than the unvaccinated control birds, reflecting the safety of 'Paracox' vaccine.\",\n",
       " 'Influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia remain among the most significant causes of morbidity and mortality of any of the infectious disease emergencies presenting to emergency departments (EDs). Because the ED has become a recommended location at which immunizations have been administered to prevent several infections, pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations can have an impact on the care of ED patients. ED personnel are uniquely positioned to vaccinate a substantial number of patients who would not otherwise be vaccinated, including many high-risk populations. In addition to decreasing vaccine-preventable mortality and morbidity from influenza and pneumococcal diseases, EDs that implement and monitor a systematic approach to these vaccinations can attenuate ED overcrowding and facilitate patient flow. ED vaccination strategies have been proved to be successful and reimbursable and are advocated by several major clinical practice advisory groups.',\n",
       " 'Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), a highly infectious and fatal disease of cattle present in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, is usually controlled by mass vaccinations. However, vaccination against CBPP is known to cause site reactions in a percentage of cattle especially in primary vaccinations. In Zambia, a record of site reactions was kept for seven consecutive years from 2005 to 2011 to establish the level of the problem. In some areas, after 3 years of consecutive vaccination campaigns, immunization could not be implemented for a period of 2 years because of logistical difficulties or owner resistance. Whereas in the three preceding years when animals were vaccinated annually, site reactions were in the range of 6.2%; on resumption of vaccination in the herds that had not been immunized for 2 years, site reactions averaged 21.3%. This data shows that the T1/44 vaccine may cause severe local reactions in cattle if there is any break in annual vaccinations. It is therefore important for authorities to ensure that the cattle at risk of contracting CBPP are regularly vaccinated to avoid discouraging farmers from presenting their animals.',\n",
       " 'AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To take a systematic approach to reviewing the scientific literature examining the timeliness of vaccination in preterm infants and to identify any factors associated with timeliness. BACKGROUND: Preterm infants are vulnerable to infection and guidance advocates they are vaccinated in accordance with their full-term peers. Vaccination is well tolerated and protective immune responses are observed, yet some early enquiries suggest that preterm infants experience unwarranted delays. The recent surge in pertussis cases and the increase in vaccinations administered make this a topic requiring further exploration. DESIGN: An integrative review of the empirical literature. METHODS: Studies were identified following a search of Medline, Academic Search Premier, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. The review methods used were influenced by a narrative synthesis approach. The retrieval of papers adhered to recognised reporting standards. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were identified, which indicated that infants with the lowest gestational ages and birthweights experience the greatest delays. Vaccination timeliness is influenced by hospitalisation and increased postdischarge follow-up. There was a lack of consensus to indicate that parental socio-economic status and level of education were indicators for a delay. The studies propose that many delays are unjustified and not according to genuine contraindications. CONCLUSION: This review indicates that preterm infants are not vaccinated in a timely manner. Those involved in vaccinating preterm infants must be informed of the genuine contraindications to avoid unnecessary delays putting preterm infants at an increased risk of infection. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Care providers should acknowledge the risk of a delay in preterm infants and actively promote vaccination in this population. Regular training should help to negate the occurrence of inappropriate delays, and careful discharge planning is needed to ensure that preterm infants are vaccinated on time.',\n",
       " \"The overall burden of illness from diseases for which vaccines are available disproportionately falls on adults. Adults are recommended to receive vaccinations based on their age, underlying medical conditions, lifestyle, prior vaccinations, and other considerations. Updated vaccine recommendations from CDC are published annually in the U.S. Adult Immunization Schedule. Vaccine use among U.S. adults is low. Although receipt of a provider (physician or other vaccinating healthcare provider) recommendation is a key predictor of vaccination, more often consumers report not receiving vaccine recommendations at healthcare provider visits. Although providers support the benefits of vaccination, they also report several barriers to vaccinating adults, including the cost of providing vaccination services, inadequate or inconsistent payment for vaccines and vaccine administration, and acute medical care taking precedence over preventive services. Despite these challenges, a number of strategies have been demonstrated to substantially improve adult vaccine coverage, including patient and provider reminders and standing orders for vaccination. Providers are encouraged to incorporate routine assessment of their adult patients' vaccination needs during all clinical encounters to ensure patients receive recommendations for needed vaccines and are either offered needed vaccines or referred for vaccination.\",\n",
       " \"The widespread use of vaccines has greatly improved global public health, preventing millions of childhood hospitalizations and deaths each year. Vaccination of children also is projected to avert adult deaths through the prevention of hepatitis B (HepB) virus--related chronic liver disease and liver cancer and human papilloma virus--related cervical cancer. When the World Health Organization (WHO) began the Expanded Programme on Immunization in 1974, <5% of the world's children had been fully vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine, oral poliovirus vaccine, and measles-containing vaccine (MCV) during the first year of life. Since then, increased vaccination coverage has resulted in substantial reductions in morbidity and mortality, including a >99% decline in polio incidence since 1988, with eradication on the horizon, and a 78% decline in measles-associated mortality from 2000 to 2008 With the introduction of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, HepB vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), and rotavirus vaccine into many countries' routine vaccination schedules, further reductions in morbidity and mortality are expected. However, based on an annual global birth cohort of approximately 130 million, an estimated 23 million infants worldwide still do not receive the benefits of routine vaccination (i.e., 3 doses of DTP during the first year of life). The Global Immunization Vision and Strategy (GIVS), developed in 2005 by WHO and UNICEF, assists countries in strengthening immunization programs and vaccinating more persons. GIVS aims to achieve 90% national 3-dose DTP (DTP3) coverage by age 12 months in all countries, and 80% coverage in every district or equivalent administrative unit by 2010 (and to sustain these levels through 2015). This report summarizes global routine vaccination coverage during 2000--2009 and progress toward achieving GIVS goals.\",\n",
       " \"Classical methods are still providing new vaccines, but molecular biology and genetic engineering have enabled new approaches to development. Changes in vaccinology have involved the isolation, presentation and administration of vaccinal antigens or attenuated vaccinal strains. New methods of vaccine delivery other than injection will be used (e.g. mucosal administration) and new vectors or adjuvants will be added to vaccines in order to stimulate specific responses. New vaccines can also be obtained by using viral-like particles (VLP of papillomavirus), conjugate polysaccharides (N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae) or the reassortment of segmented genomes (rotavirus, influenza). Here, we analyze the different steps of a vaccine's life using concrete cases of two new vaccines against papillomavirus and rotavirus. Vaccination has a promising future.\",\n",

This disease can be handled successfully with rapid diagnosis, proper antibiotic treatment, and rodent and chigger control. However, recent reports of scrub typhus outbreaks in endemic areas, and a decreased effectiveness of antibiotic treatment suggest a continued need for a suitable vaccine. This review describes the early and recent attempts in making prophylactic preparations to prevent scrub typhus, the successes and failures of these attempts, and future directions of scrub typhus vaccine development.',\n",
       " 'Adolescents with chronic medical conditions (CMCs), a growing population worldwide, possess a wide array of preventive health care needs. Vaccination is strongly recommended for the vast majority of these adolescents given their increased risk of vaccine preventable infection and associated complications. Not only should they receive routine vaccines, but some also require additional vaccines. Despite these guidelines, evidence suggests that adolescents with CMCs often fail to receive needed vaccines. Many factors contribute to this under-immunization, including lack of knowledge among parents and providers and suboptimal coordination of primary and subspecialty care. This review describes current vaccination recommendations for these adolescents as well as recent data related to infection risk, vaccine efficacy and safety, vaccination coverage, and the unique multilevel factors impacting uptake in this population. It also discusses strategies for improving coverage levels and reducing missed vaccination opportunities, with a particular focus on technology-based interventions.',\n",
       " 'Objective Vaccines including pneumococcal and influenza vaccines are recommended in patients with immunosuppressive treatment. However, vaccine coverage remains extremely low. Our study was to investigate vaccination uptake, knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) towards certain vaccinations among these patients, and to identify the factors influencing willingness to be vaccinated. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among patients with rheumatic diseases in a tertiary hospital in China. Baseline assessments were completed by using questionnaires including vaccination uptake and KAP towards certain infections and vaccinations. Results 235 patients completed the study. Mean age was 39.69\\xa0years old, while 66.4% were females. Only 6.4% of the participants once had taken vaccine in recent five years. One patient had influenza vaccination, and none ever took pneumococcal vaccine. 3.8% had doctor\\'s recommendation on taking influenza, pneumococcal or herpes zoster vaccine. Major reasons given for not being vaccinated included \"unnecessary\" (8.9%) and \"troublesome to take vaccines\" (8.5%). Patients would take influenza or pneumococcal vaccines if they had heard of them before, had knowledge of infection, and had belief in vaccine\\'s safety and reliability (p\\xa0<\\xa00.05). Conclusion Vaccine coverage among people with rheumatic diseases was low in China. Methods to improve KAP toward infections and vaccinations should be taken.',\n",

       " 'OBJECTIVE: School-based vaccination is becoming a more widely used method of vaccine delivery. However, evaluations of school-based vaccination program implementation have not been systematically reviewed. This paper describes the results of a systematic review of the literature on process (or implementation) evaluations of school-based vaccination delivery. METHODS: Search terms: \"school based vaccination\" OR ((\"schools\" OR \"school\") AND (\"immunisation\" OR \"immunization\" OR \"vaccination\")). LIMITS: Humans; English language; Age: 6-18 (school-age children and adolescents); No editorials; No letters. Databases: PUBMED; Embase.com; Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; Cinahl; Web of Science; PsycINFO. Inclusions: Articles must have originated from an advanced economic \\'developed\\' country, be peer-reviewed, available in English, randomised or non-randomised controlled design, published from 1970 to August 2010 and focused on vaccinations provided in the school setting and during school time which reported one or more outcomes. EXCLUSIONS: qualitative or descriptive papers without any evaluation component; papers that only reported on impact evaluation (i.e. number of students vaccinated); and those published before 1970. RESULTS: A total of 14 articles were identified as including some element of a process evaluation of a school-based vaccination program. Nurses, parents, teachers, and adolescents were involved in measures of procedural factors related to school-based vaccination implementation. Outcomes included return rates of consent forms; knowledge about the specific vaccine offered; attitudes toward vaccination and school-based vaccination; reasons for non-vaccination; resources, support, and procedures related to implementation; and environmental factors within the school that may impact vaccination success. Vaccination coverage was also reported in the majority of papers. CONCLUSIONS: Many studies reported on the importance of ensuring all stakeholders (school nurses, parents, teachers, and adolescents) receive appropriate information and are involved in the vaccination program and implementation processes. Specific consent form dissemination procedures have demonstrated higher return rates. Further controlled studies are needed to determine the best practice approach to implementing these programs is a variety of contexts.',\n",
       " 'A critical review of cost-effectiveness analyses of HPV vaccination in males was conducted and nine studies were identified in different countries. Due to the heterogeneity among these studies in terms of modeling approach, vaccination strategies, health outcomes considered, assumptions and parameters, limited conclusions can be drawn with regard to the absolute cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, key drivers were identified. More favorable cost-effectiveness appeared when all HPV-related diseases outcomes were considered, a suboptimal vaccine coverage among girls and/or lower vaccine prices were assumed. There was a general lack of transparency to fully describe the details of the methodological approach of modeling and calibration. Further research should be conducted to generate robust evidence-based data sets (HPV-related diseases epidemiology, costs and quality of life). The best modeling practice for HPV vaccination and how to better capture the true economic value of vaccination beyond cost-effectiveness in a broader policy context need to be investigated.',\n",
       " 'Performing a total health economic analysis of a vaccine newly introduced into the market today is a challenge when using the conventional cost-effectiveness analysis we normally apply on pharmaceutical products. There are many reasons for that, such as: the uncertainty in the total benefit (direct and indirect) to be measured in a population when using a cohort model; (1) appropriate rules about discounting the long-term impact of vaccines are absent jeopardizing therefore their value at the initial investment; (2) the presence of opposite contexts when introducing the vaccine in developed vs. the developing world with high benefits, low initial health care investment for the latter vs. marginal benefit and high cost for the former; with a corresponding paradox for the vaccine becoming very cost-effective in low income countries but rather medium in middle low to high middle income countries; (3) and the type of trial assessment for the newer vaccines is now often performed with immunogenicity reaction instead of clinical endpoints which still leaves questions on their real impact and their head-to-head comparison.

       " 'Despite the success of the national childhood vaccination program in the United States in decreasing mortality due to vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccination rates remain suboptimal. Contributing factors include the failure to appreciate the hazards of vaccine-preventable diseases, concerns about adverse reactions associated with vaccine administration, and missed opportunities to administer vaccines. The 2 major types of indications for vaccinating children are age and presence of a medical condition that increases the risk of a vaccine-preventable disease. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection becomes chronic in 90% of those infected as infants, and 25% of those so infected will die of related chronic liver disease as adults. Routine infant vaccination against hepatitis B has been recommended since 1991. Approximately 69% of infants who develop pertussis require hospitalization. Acellular pertussis vaccines have been licensed for use in infancy. Starting in 2000, the all-inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) schedule is recommended. IPV should eliminate vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was licensed in 2000 for routine use on a schedule of 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months. The first dose of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is now recommended at age 12 to 15 months, simultaneous with varicella vaccine administration.',\n",

Against the backdrop of ethical and regulatory constraints, constant progress is being made in creating the best possible conditions for animal experimentation. Keeping up to date with the constant changes in the field of animal ethics requires a particular effort on the part of the pharmaceutical industry, which must make careful changes to product registration documentation in accordance with each new development.\",\n",
       " 'The aging immune system, so-called immunosenescence, is well documented as the cause of increased infection rates and severe, often complicated course of infections in the elderly with increased morbidity and mortality rates. Furthermore, it can lead to decreased efficacy of vaccination. The administration of more immunogenic vaccines can be beneficial in the elderly. Implementing vaccination recommendations for the elderly by STIKO can reduce burden of infectious diseases by prevention of infection or reduction of severity of infection. The following vaccinations are recommended by STIKO for all persons aged 60 and above: annual influenza vaccination (additionally all nursing home residents independently of age), once only pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination, completion of tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccination as well as regular revaccination. All adults should be vaccinated against pertussis with Tdap vaccine once. Meanwhile, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is allowed for administration in adults but is not recommended by STIKO yet. A lifelong course of vaccination may help to attenuate the effect of immunosenescence.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Immunomodulators and biological agents, used to treat inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], are associated with an increased risk of infection, including vaccine-preventable infections. We assessed patient attitudes towards vaccination, knowledge of vaccine recommendations, and uptake of recommended vaccines. METHODS: Patients attending IBD clinics completed a self-administered, structured, paper-based questionnaire. We collected demographic data, medical and immunisation history, self-reported patient uptake, knowledge, and perceptions of childhood and adult vaccinations. RESULTS: The prevalence of treatment with biologicals, steroids, thiopurines, and methotrexate among the 300 respondents were 37.3%, 16.0%, 16.0%, and 5.7%, respectively. Self-reported vaccine completion was reported by 45.3% of patients. Vaccination uptake rates were 61.3% for influenza, 10.3% for pneumococcus, 61.0% for hepatitis B, 52.0% for hepatitis A, 26.0% for varicella, 20.7% for meningococcus, 5.3% for herpes zoster, and 11.0% for herpes papilloma virus [females only]. Significant predictors of vaccine completion were annual vaccination review by family physician (odds ratio [OR] = 1.82) or gastroenterologist [OR = 1.72], current steroid use [OR = 1.28], and current or prior treatment with biologicals [OR = 1.42]. The majority of patients reported that the primary responsibility to ensure vaccine completion lies with the patient [41.7%] and the family physician [32.3%]. Uncertainty about indications, fears of side effects, and concerns regarding vaccine safety were the most commonly reported reasons for non-uptake [22.0%, 20.7%, and 5.3%, respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: Uptake of recommended vaccines among IBD patients is suboptimal. Annual vaccination reviews by both family physician and gastroenterologist may improve vaccine uptake. Interventions targeted at improving vaccination uptake in IBD patients are needed.',\n",
       " 'QUESTION: One of my patients is studying to become a dental hygienist. Owing to the program requirements, she received several vaccinations last week, including measles-mumps-rubella, varicella, and hepatitis B (HB) vaccines, as well as a tetanus booster. However, today a blood test confirmed that she is currently 6 weeks pregnant. What is known about the safety of these vaccines during pregnancy, and are there any general recommendations for vaccines for women who are planning to become pregnant or who are currently pregnant? ANSWER: The combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and the varicella vaccine are live attenuated vaccines, and are contraindicated during pregnancy owing to theoretical concerns. However, there is no evidence that there are increased risks of malformations, congenital rubella syndrome, or varicella syndrome attributable to these vaccines. The HB and tetanus vaccines are composed of noninfectious particles or toxoids, and theoretically should cause no increased risk to the developing fetus. In addition, limited observational data also support no increased risk of any adverse pregnancy outcomes; consequently, administration of the HB and tetanus vaccines might be, if indicated, considered during pregnancy.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Children eligible for the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program are immunized against influenza at lower rates and less likely to receive their second recommended dose. Live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) has higher vaccine efficacies (VEs) than trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). Increased use of LAIV could provide better protection against influenza for this vulnerable population. METHODS: Published VE estimates and vaccine utilization data from a nationwide study of randomly selected pediatric practices were used to model percentages of VFC children that would be immune following immunization. RESULTS: A total of 22,329 influenza vaccine doses were administered to 20,626 VFC-eligible children aged 24 months to 17 years in the study population. Among children recommended to receive 2 doses, only 1234 of 3018 (41%) aged 24 to 59 months and 469 of 1908 (25%) aged 5 to 8 years received their second dose. Of the vaccinated VFC population, 73% to 83% would be immune using LAIV compared with 53% to 68% with TIV. Differences in aggregate immunity were greatest among 24- to 59-month olds with 71% to 78% of LAIV immunized children immune compared with 48% to 60% with TIV. In this model, 29% to 47% more children aged 24 to 59 months would be immune prior to peak influenza season when vaccinated with LAIV. CONCLUSIONS: Because VE is higher and most VFC children fail to receive their second recommended dose, population protection is substantially higher with LAIV. Although LAIV cannot be given to all children, LAIV should be used preferentially for the VFC population, particularly for children aged 24 to 59 months and those needing 2 doses.',\n",

       " \"Maria Luigia (Marie Louise) of Habsburg, daughter of the Austrian Emperor and, as Napoleon Bonaparte's second wife, Empress of the French, after the defeat of the husband in 1814 was relegated to role of Duchesse of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla. She arrived in Parma in 1816 accompanied by several Austrian army and administrative officials, which were instructing and controlling her, and, willingly, she left to them most of the political and administrative decisions. On the contrary, since the first years she was interested and wanted to take decisions in the field of public health and charity. She opened new specialized hospitals and hospices for poor people, orphans and abandoned children, and, in February of 1820, promulgated the new «Regulations of the vaccinations», an exhaustive and specific code, that was taking into consideration the times, the places, and the people who had to vaccinate or to be vaccinated. Moreover, she fixed the modalities, the incentives, the sanctions, and she also nominated a series of people who had to publicize vaccinations and to help the general population inovercoming fears, prejudices and other causes of distrust. The new dispositions increased the number of vaccinated people in the Duchy, saving it from several epidemics that appeared in the following decades in the neighboring regions (Tuscany, Lombardy). In 1831 and 1832 she issued other two ordinances in which she urged the populations and the doctors to increase the vaccinations, probably after a decrease in interest of both, and introduced new practical arrangements to simplify and to facilitate the practice, ensuring and verifying the outcome. The effectiveness of the provisions of Maria Luigia has been shown by the marked decrease in smallpox epidemics throughout her whole reign, until 1847. Meanwhile after the end of the reign, in the second part of the nineteenth century, there was an increase of epidemics, because the following governments of the Bourbons Duchy (1847-1860) and of the united Italy after 1860 were not as diligent and active on spreading vaccinations.\",\n",
       " 'Vaccinations are one of the most effective measures of preventing infection illnesses. In Germany adequate vaccination rates have so far been achieved only partially. 85 - 90 % of all vaccinations are carried out by the general practitioner, who in this context plays a key role. He/she assumes varied duties such as advice on vaccinations, administering vaccines and recording it. Visits to a doctor should also be used for checking on vaccination protection and if necessary its updating. In addition continual updating the vaccination recommendations of the Permanent Vaccination Commission (Ständige Impfkommission) should be followed as guideline. Regardless of the recommended vaccinations for adults additional indications for vaccinating individuals e. g. pertussis vaccination, can be put into effect. Vaccinations of adults should always be carried out by taking into account a persons?s life situation.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Between 2010 and 2014, the percentage of 13-17 year-old girls administered ≥3 doses of the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine (\"fully vaccinated\") increased by 7.7 percentage points to 39.7%, and the percentage not administered any doses of the HPV vaccine (\"not immunized\") decreased by 11.3 percentage points to 40.0%. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the complex interactions between parents\\' vaccine-related beliefs, demographic factors, and HPV immunization status. METHODS: Vaccine-related parental beliefs and sociodemographic data collected by the 2010 National Immunization Survey-Teen among teen girls (n=8490) were analyzed. HPV vaccination status was determined from teens\\' health care provider (HCP) records. RESULTS: Among teen girls either unvaccinated or fully vaccinated against HPV, teen girls whose parent was positively influenced to vaccinate their teen daughter against HPV were 48.2 percentage points more likely to be fully vaccinated. Parents who reported being positively influenced to vaccinate against HPV were 28.9 percentage points more likely to report that their daughter\\'s HCP talked about the HPV vaccine, 27.2 percentage points more likely to report that their daughter\\'s HCP gave enough time to discuss the HPV shot, and 43.4 percentage points more likely to report that their daughter\\'s HCP recommended the HPV vaccine (p<0.05). Among teen girls administered 1-2 doses of the HPV vaccine, 87.0% had missed opportunities for HPV vaccine administration. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that an important pathway to achieving higher ≥3 dose HPV vaccine coverage is by increasing HPV vaccination series initiation though HCP talking to parents about the HPV vaccine, giving parents time to discuss the vaccine, and by making a strong recommendation for the HPV. Also, HPV vaccination series completion rates may be increased by eliminating missed opportunities to vaccinate against HPV and scheduling additional follow-up visits to administer missing HPV vaccine doses.',\n",
       " 'Ten Jersey heifers aged 14 to 23 months were vaccinated with 2.25 x 10(8) cells of living Brucella abortus strain 19 vaccine. They and 10 similar non-vaccinated heifers were subsequently mated and when about 6 months pregnant were challenged by the conjunctival application of a virulent culture of B. abortus. The serological responses to vaccination was much less than is usually seen following vaccination with the normal dose of strain 19, especially when the indirect haemolysis test was used. A persistent vaccinal reaction was observed in one heifer. Significant resistance to infection was demonstrated which was greater than that previously observed in calfhood vaccinates given the full dose but less than that shown by cows given the smaller dose in early pregnancy. The effectiveness of strain 19 vaccination appears to be related to the age of the animal at vaccination.',\n",

Nevertheless, approximately 19.9 million of the world's annual birth cohort are either under-immunized or have not been vaccinated at all. Understanding the factors contributing to under-immunization in settinsg such as sub-Saharan Africa which bears a disproportionate burden of vaccine preventable diseases is key to unlocking the full potential that vaccines offer in reducing under-5 morbidity and mortality. The series or articles in this issue of the Journal, mainly through systematic analysis of District Health Surveillance data bases from 35 countries, highlight the challenges faced in improving vaccination coverage rates in sub-Saharan Africa which has stagnated at approximately 72% for completion of the primary series of infant vaccines over the past decade. The reasons for under-immunization of children is sub-Saharan Africa is identified to be multi-factorial and may differ between and within countries. This highlights the need for country-specific, possibly at a district or sub-regional level, interrogation of factors contributing to under-immunization of children, to work toward providing Universal Health Coverage as envisioned in the Sustainable Development Goals.\",\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: Many travelers to regions with endemic infectious diseases do not follow health authorities' recommendations regarding vaccination against vaccine-preventable infectious diseases, before traveling. The determinants of individual travelers' decisions to vaccinate before traveling are largely unknown. This study aimed to provide this information using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) administered to four types of German travelers: (1) business travelers; (2) travelers visiting friends and relatives (VFR); (3) leisure travelers; and (4) backpackers. METHODS: A DCE survey was developed, pretested and administered online. It included a series of choice questions in which respondents chose between two hypothetical vaccines, each characterized by four disease attributes with varying levels describing the of risk, health impact, curability and transmissibility of the disease they would prevent (described with four disease attributes with varying levels of risk, health impact, curability and transmissibility), and varying levels of four vaccine attributes (duration of protection, number of doses required, time required for vaccination, and vaccine cost). A random-parameters logit model was used to estimate the importance weights each traveler type placed on the various attribute levels. These weights were used to calculate mean monetary equivalents (MMEs) of changes in each attribute (holding all others constant) and of hypothetical disease-vaccine combinations. RESULTS: All traveler types' choices indicated that they attached the greatest importance to the risk and health impact of disease and to the vaccine cost whereas the other disease and vaccine attributes were less important for their decisions about travel vaccines. An option of not choosing any of the vaccine-pairs presented was rarely selected indicating that travelers' generally prefer to be vaccinated rather than not. The MMEs of changes in vaccine attributes indicated a very high variability between the individual travelers within each type. CONCLUSIONS: The travelers' responses indicated strong preferences for selecting vaccination rather than opting out of vaccination, and disease risk, health impact and vaccine cost were the most important features for vaccine choice.\",\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Low vaccination coverage as well as incomplete and delayed vaccinations pose a risk for the individual and population protection from vaccine-preventable diseases. AIM: To describe vaccination patterns for nationally recommended basic and supplementary vaccinations in Swiss preschool children. METHODS: We performed a descriptive study based on administrative claims data from a large Swiss health insurer (Helsana), in cohorts of children born between January 2010 and December 2016. We assessed coverage rates of nationally recommended basic vaccinations (i.e., diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis [DTaP], Haemophilus influenzae type b [Hib], poliomyelitis [IPV], measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR]) and supplementary vaccinations (i.e., pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV] and meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine [MCV]) for each birth cohort at the age of 13, 25, and 37\\xa0months. Additionally, we analysed timeliness of vaccinations using inverse Kaplan-Meier curves. Results were extrapolated to the Swiss population. RESULTS: The study population comprised 563,216 children. We observed continuously increasing coverage rates for all vaccinations until the 2015 birth cohort. Overall, up-to-date status for the first dose of studied vaccinations at 37\\xa0months was as follows: DTaP: 95.4%; Hib: 94.9%; IPV: 95.5%; MMR: 86.8%; PCV: 83.2%; and MCV: 66.7%. On average, however, only seven out of ten children had an up-to-date status for completed basic vaccinations; even less (six out of ten) were up-to-date for recommended supplementary vaccinations at 37\\xa0months of age. Moreover, 4% of all analysed children received none of the recommended vaccinations and there were substantial regional differences. Delays in vaccine administration were common. The most frequently postponed basic vaccination was MMR; 22.6% of children vaccinated with the first dose experienced delays relative to age-appropriate standards. CONCLUSION: To avoid future outbreaks and transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccination coverage in Switzerland must be further improved. In addition, more emphasis should be placed on timely vaccination.',\n",

       " 'Many countries have considered or are considering modifying their seasonal influenza immunization policies. Estimating the impact of such changes requires understanding the existing clinical and economic burden of influenza, as well as the potential impact of different vaccination options. Previous studies suggest that vaccinating clinical risk groups, health care workers, children and the elderly may be cost-effective. However, challenges in such estimation include: (1) potential cases are not usually virologically tested; (2) cases have non-specific symptoms and are rarely reported to surveillance systems; (3) endpoints for influenza proxies (such as influenza-like illness) need to be matched to case definitions for treatment costs, (4) disease burden estimates vary from year to year with strain transmissibility, virulence and prior immunity, (5) methods to estimate productivity losses due to influenza vary, (6) vaccine efficacy estimates from trials differ due to variation in subtype prevalence, vaccine match and case ascertainment, and (7) indirect (herd) protection from vaccination depends on setting-specific variables that are difficult to directly measure. Given the importance of knowing the impact of changes to influenza policy, such complexities need careful treatment using tools such as population-based trial designs, meta-analyses, time-series analyses and transmission dynamic models.',\n",
       " 'The poultry industry constitutes a significant sector of world agriculture. In the United States, more than 8 billion birds are produced yearly with a value exceeding $20 billion. Broiler chickens are the largest segment of the industry. Birds raised under commercial conditions are vulnerable to environmental exposure to a number of pathogens. Therefore, disease prevention by vaccination is an integral part of flock health management protocols. Active immunization using live vaccines is the current industry standard. Routinely used vaccines in chickens include MDV, NDV, IBV, and IBDV, and in turkeys NDV and HEV. Newer vaccines, including molecular recombinants in which genes of immunogenic proteins from infectious agents are inserted into a live viral vector, are also being examined for commercial use. Efforts are under way to enhance vaccine efficacy by the use of adjuvants, particularly cytokines. The vaccine delivery systems include in ovo injection, aerosol, spray, drinking water, eye drop, and wing web injection. The in ovo vaccination procedure is relatively new and at the present time it is used primarily to vaccinate broiler chickens against MDV. Birds respond to vaccines by developing humoral and cellular immune responses. Bursa of Fabricius and the thymus serve as the primary lymphoid organs of the immune system. B cells use surface immunoglobulins as antigen receptors and differentiate into plasma cells to secrete antibodies. Three classes of antibodies are produced: IgM, IgG (also called IgY), and IgA. Successful vaccinal response in a flock is often monitored by demonstrating a rise in antibody titer within a few days of vaccination. ELISA is used most commonly for serologic monitoring. T cells are the principal effector cells of specific cellular immunity. T cells differentiate into alpha beta and gamma delta cells. In adult birds, gamma delta cells may constitute up to 50% of the circulating T cells. Functionally, CD4+ cells serve as helper cells and CD8+ cells as cytotoxic/suppressor cells.',\n",
       " 'Children with onco-hematological diseases are at increased risk of infection. However, this risk can in part be controlled or reduced using currently available vaccines. Despite available evidence, in patients diagnosed with a hematological or oncological disease the vaccination schedule is often inappropriately discontinued. In this study we evaluated whether the diagnosis of an oncological or hematological disease is a determinant of noncompliance with recommended vaccinations.The study was carried out between March and April 2019. The population was composed of a convenience sample of 228 children cared for in the Pediatric Oncology Department and Pediatric Hematology Department of the Policlinico Giovanni XXIII Pediatric Hospital (Bari, Italy) from 2005 to 2015. Information on the immunization status of the patients was obtained from the Apulia regional immunization database (GIAVA). A post-diagnosis adherence score was calculated.The vaccination coverage was 87.7% for the DTaP-IPV-Hep B-Hib vaccine (3 doses), 68.7% for the pneumococcal vaccine (3 doses), 75.8% for the MMR vaccine (2 doses) and 75.1% for the varicella vaccine (2 doses). The average age at vaccination was older than that recommended by the National Vaccination Plan. A diagnosis of oncological disease and an older age at enrollment were risk factors for missing vaccinations. These results showed that the overall vaccination status of pediatric onco-hematological patients is suboptimal. Improving provider communication and establishing the hospital as the primary environment for vaccine administration may lead to better vaccination compliance in this group.',\n",
       " \"Vaccination decisions, as in choosing whether or not to immunize one's small child against specific diseases, are both psychologically and computationally complex. The psychological complexities have been extensively studied, often in the context of shaping convincing or persuasive messages that will encourage parents to vaccinate their children. The computational complexity of the decision has been less noted. However, even if the parent has access to neutral, accurate, credible information on vaccination risks and benefits, he or she can easily be overwhelmed by the task of combining this information into a well-reasoned decision. We argue here that the Internet, in addition to its potential as an information source, could provide useful assistance to parents in integrating factual information with their own values and preferences - that is, in providing real decision aid as well as information aid. We sketch one approach for accomplishing this by means of a hierarchy of interactive decision aids ranging from simple advice to full-scale decision analysis.\",\n",
       " 'The aim of this study was to compare the public health impact of introducing 2 Herpes Zoster (HZ) vaccines, Zoster Vaccine Live (ZVL) versus a non-live adjuvanted subunit candidate vaccine (HZ/su), in the German population aged 50+ years split into 3 age cohorts, i.e. 50-59, 60-69 and 70+ years, respectively. A multi-cohort static Markov model was developed following age cohorts over their lifetime. Demographic data were obtained from the German federal statistical office. HZ incidence and the proportion of HZ individuals developing post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) were derived from German specific sources. Age-specific vaccine efficacy and waning rates were based on published clinical trial data. Vaccine coverage for both vaccines was assumed to be 40%, with compliance of the second dose of the HZ/su vaccine of 70%. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the results. It was estimated that, over the remaining lifetime since vaccination, the HZ/su vaccine would reduce the number of HZ cases by 725,233, 533,162 and 486,794 in the 3 age cohorts, respectively, compared with 198,477, 196,000 and 104,640, using ZVL. The number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one HZ case ranged from 8 to 11 using the HZ/su vaccine compared with 20 to 50 using ZVL. Corresponding NNV to prevent one PHN case ranged from 39 to 53 using the HZ/su vaccine compared with 94 to 198 using ZVL. Due to the higher, sustained vaccine efficacy, the candidate HZ/su vaccine demonstrated superior public health impact compared with ZVL.',\n",
       " \"OBJECTIVE: During the 2000 to 2001 influenza season, distribution of influenza vaccine was delayed, and national self-reported vaccination rates declined. The purposes of this study were to characterize missed opportunities for adult vaccinations and assess the impact of the vaccine delay on missed opportunities for influenza vaccination as recorded in medical records. METHODS: In a cross-sectional analysis, medical record data from 217 adult patients aged > or =65 years in primary care practices that received influenza vaccine supplies late in 2000 were used to assess rates and missed opportunities to vaccinate. Missed opportunities were defined as visits in which there was no record that vaccine had been given, discussed, or refused by the patient. RESULTS: During the mean study period of 37.1 +/- 5.7 months, patients averaged 12.1 +/- 5.9 visits to their primary care physician's office. Medical records indicated that 75% of patients had received pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) and 30% had received tetanus toxoid from 1991 to 2001; 81% had received at least one influenza vaccine in the previous 4 seasons. During the 2000 to 2001 influenza season, influenza vaccination rates declined significantly to 41% from 57% in 1999 to 2000. Overall missed opportunities to vaccinate during the study period averaged 3.4 +/- 3.0 for influenza vaccine, 10.7 +/- 7.3 for pneumococcal vaccine, and 10.8 +/- 5.9 for tetanus toxoid. During the delay season, the number of visits increased, but missed opportunities to vaccinate also increased significantly, even after vaccine supplies had been received. CONCLUSIONS: Missed opportunities to vaccinate occur frequently and vaccine shortages create additional challenges to adult vaccination. Missed opportunities may be minimized and maintenance of accurate adult immunization records may be achieved by assessing and recording vaccination status at each visit, regardless of vaccine availability. By so doing, providers can easily convey the message to their patients that immunizations are an important part of their care.\",\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Mathematical models have formalized how free-rider effects can threaten the stability of high vaccine coverage levels under established voluntary vaccination programs. However, little research has addressed the question of when free-riding begins to develop when a new vaccine is first introduced in a population. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we combine a game theoretical model of vaccinating behavior with an age-structured compartmental model to analyze rational vaccinating behavior in the first years of a universal immunization program, where a new vaccine is free to all children of a specified age. The model captures how successive birth cohorts face different epidemiological landscapes that have been shaped by the vaccinating decisions of previous birth cohorts, resulting in a strategic interaction between individuals in different birth cohorts. The model predicts a Nash equilibrium coverage level of for the first few birth cohorts under the new program. However, free-riding behavior emerges very quickly, with the Nash equilibrium vaccine coverage dropping significantly within 2-5 years after program initiation. Subsequently, a rich set of coupled dynamics between infection prevalence and vaccinating behaviors is possible, ranging from relatively stable (but reduced) coverage in later birth cohorts to wide fluctuations in vaccine coverage from one birth cohort to the next. Individual tolerance for vaccine risk also starts out at relatively high levels before dropping significantly within a few years. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that even relatively new immunization programs can be vulnerable to drops in vaccine coverage caused by vaccine scares and exacerbated by herd immunity effects, necessitating vigilance from the start.',\n",

We aim to describe current vaccination recommendations in practice, immunization status, and vaccination safety for premature infants in Zhejiang. METHODS: The demographic information, medical records of treatments, and adverse events following immunization (AEFI) history were collected from infants' parents by questionnaire in the Vaccination Consultation Clinic(VCC). Vaccination data were retrieved from Zhejiang Provincial Immunization Information System. The information of AEFI was collected from the Chinese National Adverse Event Following Immunization Information System. RESULTS: A total of 1515 premature infants visiting the VCC were included in the study. The majority (65.94%) of them were under 7\\xa0months. 47.59% of premature infants were advised to receive normal vaccinations, while 45.94% were advised to defer a specific vaccination and 6.47% were advised to defer all vaccinations. A total of 807 infants received 7187 vaccine doses were administered and only seven cases experienced mild and self-limiting adverse reactions (9.74/10,000). No uncommon or serious side effects were reported. CONCLUSION: Most premature infants visiting the VCC did not receive vaccines on time. The majority of them can be safely vaccinated according to the national-recommended schedule.\",\n",

He has explained his theories about \"microbes\" and has predominant advice. Toussaint admires Pasteur; in the year 1879 he finds first and isolates the microbe of \"cholera des poules\" (now Pasteurella) and gives Pasteur this new germ which will be used by Pasteur for his particular works about reducing of virulence by successive subcultures. In 1880 with his publishing on July 12 at the Academy of Science, Toussaint presents his successful result with an attenuated vaccine against anthrax: he has got protection against anthrax for dogs and sheep by using a vaccine which he has reduced off virulence by chemical manner. Academy congratulates him. Pasteur jealous of one\\'s reputation contests the demonstration of Toussaint because he does not believe in the chemical method too different from his tests but will make use of this method for an experience open to the public in Pouilly-le-Fort in 1881.

       " 'In order for vaccines to be effective within a given population not only do large numbers of people need to be vaccinated, but a large proportion of those vaccinated must develop protective immunity. The mechanisms that lead to a poor immune response to vaccination are complex and poorly understood, but include both genetic and environmental factors. The bacteria that exist throughout the human body, known as the microbiome, play a variety of roles in the development of the immune system. This is particularly true during infancy when the microbiome and the immune response are developing in tandem. Most vaccines are administered in early childhood to prevent outbreaks of devastating childhood diseases. Understanding the impact that the early microbiome plays in response to vaccination will improve our understanding of vaccine efficacy.',\n",

In this paper we discuss: (1) what reactions are expected from COVID-19 vaccines, (2) what precautions are needed when vaccinating people, and (3) how to act when allergic reactions occur. The COVID-19 vaccines include the first vaccines produced with the mRNA platform. The most frequent adverse reactions are comparable with other vaccines. Allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines are rare but can occur. These reactions may be related to excipients in the vaccines, like polyethylene glycol. In case of a possible allergic reaction, a doctor, in consultation with an allergist, can investigate whether vaccination is safe in the future and whether precautions are necessary. Allergic reactions to vaccine components must be recorded completely and unambiguously in the patient file.',\n",

Ezeject syringes were compared with standard 3-cc syringes and 10-dose measles vaccine vials in the vaccination of 884 Guatemalan infants 8-23 months of age. Vaccination was performed by experienced vaccinators and by individuals without prior vaccination experience who received 2.5-3 hours of training. The overall seroconversion rate following administration was 96%, regardless of the type of syringe used or of the experience of the vaccinator. No significant adverse events were observed in children vaccinated with the new syringes. Although incomplete emptying was noted in 87% of the Ezeject syringes used, this had no effect on the serologic response to measles vaccine. Aspiration for detection of blood before injection of the vaccine was performed significantly (P less than .001) less frequently with Ezeject than with 3-cc syringes by both experienced and inexperienced personnel. Inexperienced vaccinators administered measles vaccine significantly faster (P less than .001) with Ezeject than with 3-cc syringes, but the times were similar for experienced vaccinators.

Coverage by age 24 months was at least 90% nationally for ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine, ≥1 dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), ≥3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), and ≥1 dose of varicella vaccine, although MMR coverage was <90% in 20 states.

Only 1.3% of children born in 2015 and 2016 had received no vaccinations by the second birthday. Coverage was lower for uninsured children and for children insured by Medicaid than for those with private health insurance. Vaccination coverage can be increased by improving access to vaccine providers and eliminating missed opportunities to vaccinate children during health care visits. Increased use of local vaccination coverage data is needed to identify communities at higher risk for outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases.',\n",

A self-administered questionnaire was used to seek information about: 1) socio-demographic characteristics; 2) knowledge of vaccine-preventable diseases; 3) attitudes towards vaccinations; 4) behavior regarding vaccinations. 57.2% had a fair/satisfactory knowledge of vaccine-preventable diseases. This knowledge was significantly higher in those who had at least one graduated parent, those who had received information about the vaccines from physicians and those who needed additional information about the vaccines. With regards to attitude, 41.3% of adolescents had a very favorable attitude by responding 9 or 10 towards the utility of vaccines in preventing diseases. This was significantly associated with the usefulness of information received about vaccinations and with age of respondents. Regarding vaccination decisions, 47.2% believed that adolescents should make vaccination decisions for themselves.

Anecdotal evidence, the media, and South African-based anti-vaccination websites and blogs point to the existence of anti-vaccination lobbies in South Africa, although the part played by these lobbies in sub-optimal vaccination coverage is unknown at present. This article discusses some of the claims made by South African anti-vaccination groups, including some drawn from anti-vaccination lobbyists based in highly resourced countries. While research is underway to better understand the scope and influence of anti-vaccine groups, it is important to build capacity among healthcare workers within the Expanded Programme on Immunisation of South Africa to enable them to deal empathically and effectively with parents and caregivers who have been exposed to anti-vaccination messages and who question the need to vaccinate their children. Claims that vaccines cause adverse effects need to be supported by valid and reliable scientific evidence. However, evidence alone that vaccines are safe and effective does not always result in parents being convinced to vaccinate their children. In addition to providing important evidence of vaccine safety, this paper discusses the important role of communication - especially dialogue - in building public trust in vaccination with the ultimate goal of increasing vaccination coverage and preventing future outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.',\n",
       " \"The use of vaccines is still one of the most effective tools to control infectious diseases. Up to now, conventional vaccines are employed in the majority of cases. Drawbacks of these established vaccines include the lack of differentiability of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA or marker strategy), limitations in the efficacy spectrum, and constraints and restrictions in production. For this reason, new vaccines, which do not show these disadvantages, are under development, especially for notifiable diseases such as classical swine fever (CSF). In principle, the following modern vaccine types can be differentiated: recombinant attenuated vaccines, recombinant inactivated vaccines or subunit vaccines, vector vaccines, and DNA/ RNA vaccines. During the last years, especially attenuated deletion vaccines or chimeric constructs have shown potential. Under field conditions, all marker vaccines have to be accompanied by a potent test system. Particularly this point often shows weaknesses. Alternative vaccine candidates are so far only prototypes and licensing is only a medium term possibility. Moreover, most of these vaccines are genetically engineered and can be problematic in terms of licensing and the public's acceptance. In conclusion, conventional vaccines still present the standard, especially in terms of efficacy. Yet, only vaccines with DIVA properties are feasible for the control of CSF. Thus, development and assessment of alternative vaccines is of paramount importance. The present overview summarizes concepts and vaccine types using the example of classical swine fever. It also recapitulates their advantages and disadvantages as well as their limitations.\",\n",

       " 'Vaccination is considered to be the most effective and the cheapest medical intervention through which individual and collective immunisation is achieved. Statistics show that, at present, immunisation annually saves 400 million lives and protects approximately 750,000 children against disabilities of varying degrees. Approximately 80% of worldwide children are vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, etc.; these diseases used to be considered incurable in the past. Vaccines help the body to produce antibodies; they help the immune system to detect germs and inactivate their cells. The immunological protection is installed after a variable period of time following the inoculation and is long lasting. Immunisations can be achieved in several ways: through national immunisation campaigns with general recommendation--they may be compulsory, optional or prophylactic (for the diseases for which a vaccine is available); vaccinations not included in the compulsory immunisation programmes; they may also be targeted to the contagious infectious outbreaks or to groups of population in certain situations. There is no guarantee that a vaccine will provide 100% protection. However, it will significantly reduce the risk of getting an infection. Vaccines have side effects which can be divided into reactions triggered by the vaccine or reactions exacerbated by it, without a causal relationship to the vaccine.',\n",
       " 'Vaccination is an effective public health tool for reducing morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases. However, increasing numbers of parents question the safety of vaccines or refuse to vaccinate their children outright. The Internet is playing a significant role in the growing voice of the anti-vaccination movement as a growing number of people use the Internet to obtain health information, including information about vaccines. Given the role the Internet plays in providing vaccination-related communication, coupled with limited research in this area, this study focused on the social media platform Pinterest, analyzing 800 vaccine-related pins through a quantitative content analysis. The majority of the pins were anti-vaccine, and most were original posts as opposed to repins. Concerns about vaccine safety and side effects were oft-repeated themes, as was the concept of conspiracy theory. Pro-vaccine pins elicited consistently more engagement than anti-vaccine pins. Health educators and public health organizations should be aware of these dynamics, since a successful health communication campaign should start with an understanding of what and how publics communicate about the topic at hand.',\n",
       " \"At ages 11 through 12 years, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that preteens receive 1 dose of tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, 1 dose of meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) vaccine, and 3 doses of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. ACIP recommends administration of all age-appropriate vaccines during a single visit. ACIP also recommends that pre-teens and older adolescents receive an annual influenza vaccine as well as any overdue vaccines (e.g., varicella). To monitor vaccination coverage among persons aged 13-17 years, CDC analyzed data from the National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen). This report highlights findings of that analysis. From 2011 to 2012, coverage increased for ≥1 Tdap vaccine dose (from 78.2% to 84.6%), ≥1 MenACWY vaccine dose (from 70.5% to 74.0%) and, among males, ≥1 HPV vaccine dose (from 8.3% to 20.8%). Among females, vaccination coverage estimates for each HPV vaccine series dose were similar in 2012 compared with 2011. Coverage varied substantially among states. Regarding Healthy People 2020 targets for adolescents, 36 states achieved targets for Tdap, 12 for MenACWY, and nine for varicella vaccine coverage. Large and increasing coverage differences between Tdap and other vaccines recommended for adolescents indicate that substantial missed opportunities remain for vaccinating teens, especially against HPV infection. Health-care providers should administer recommended HPV and meningococcal vaccinations to boys and girls during the same visits when Tdap vaccine is given. In addition, whether for health problems or well-checks, providers, parents, and adolescents should use every health-care visit as an opportunity to review adolescents' immunization histories and ensure that every adolescent is fully vaccinated.\",\n",
       " 'Adult immunization rates have fallen short of national goals partly because of misconceptions about the safety and benefits of current vaccines. The danger of these misconceptions is magnified during pregnancy, when concerned physicians are hesitant to administer vaccines and patients are reluctant to accept them. Routine vaccines that generally are safe to administer during pregnancy include diphtheria, tetanus, influenza, and hepatitis B. Other vaccines, such as meningococcal and rabies, may be considered. Vaccines that are contraindicated, because of the theoretic risk of fetal transmission, include measles, mumps, and rubella; varicella; and bacille Calmette-Guerin. A number of other vaccines have not yet been adequately studied; therefore, theoretic risks of vaccination must be weighed against the risks of the disease to mother and fetus. Inadvertent administration of any of these vaccinations, however, is not considered an indication for termination of the pregnancy.',\n",

       " \"OBJECTIVES: An increasing number of vaccines are recommended or are being developed for use during pregnancy to protect women, fetuses, and/or newborns. For vaccines that are already recommended, vaccine uptake is variable and well below desired target. We reviewed the literature related to factors that affect a healthcare provider's recommendation and a woman's willingness to be vaccinated during pregnancy. DESIGN: A scoping review of published literature from 2005 to 2015 was undertaken and all relevant articles were abstracted, summarized, and organized thematically. RESULTS: Barriers and facilitators were identified that either decreased or increased the likelihood of a healthcare provider offering and a pregnant woman accepting vaccination during pregnancy. Concern about the safety of vaccines given during pregnancy was the most often cited barrier among both the public and healthcare providers. Other barriers included doubt about the effectiveness of the vaccine, lack of knowledge about the burden of disease, and not feeling oneself to be at risk of the infection. Major facilitators for maternal immunization included specific safety information about the vaccine in pregnant women, strong national recommendations, and healthcare providers who both recommended and provided the vaccine to their patients. Systems barriers such as inadequate facilities and staffing, vaccine purchase and storage, and reimbursement for vaccination were also cited. Evidence-based interventions were few, and included text messaging reminders, chart reminders, and standing orders. CONCLUSIONS: In order to have an effective vaccination program, improvements in the uptake of recommended vaccines during pregnancy are needed. A maternal immunization platform is required that normalizes vaccination practice among obstetrical care providers and is supported by basic and continuing education, communication strategy, and a broad range of research.\",\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVE: Despite the many advances obtained thanks to vaccination, in recent years it has been a marked drop in vaccination coverage. In fact, data show the failure in reaching the 95% of coverage, equal to the safety threshold for almost all vaccinations. This is due to the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy. Aim of this study is to describe knowledge, attitudes and perceptions respect to childhood vaccinations in a sample of parents of patients of a Free Choice Pediatrician (PLS) in the territory of Salerno Local Healthcare Service, (ASL) to assess what might be the educational needs of parents to decrease the hesitation. METHODS: A quantitative observational descriptive and phenomenological study was conducted, recruiting parents belonging to a PLS in ASL Salerno, through a questionnaire constructed ad hoc. RESULTS: Parents are not always favorable to vaccination and for some vaccine they fear a bond with a pharmaceutical business. All have vaccinated their children but not for all available vaccinations. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS . Through the educational means of the PLS doubts about vaccinations are minor and the sample of children is vaccinated, although parents appear not totally supportive and considers vaccinations as a warranty by the ASL. The sample has shown a discrepancy between the health workers about the need to vaccinate or not. Hence the need to train the health care professional before and make him responsible and then inform, through a dedicated path, who should receive the vaccine.',\n",
       " \"People's inability to update their memories in light of corrective information may have important public health consequences, as in the case of vaccination choice. In the present study, we compare three potentially effective strategies in vaccine promotion: one contrasting myths vs. facts, one employing fact and icon boxes, and one showing images of non-vaccinated sick children. Beliefs in the autism/vaccines link and in vaccines side effects, along with intention to vaccinate a future child, were evaluated both immediately after the correction intervention and after a 7-day delay to reveal possible backfire effects. Results show that existing strategies to correct vaccine misinformation are ineffective and often backfire, resulting in the unintended opposite effect, reinforcing ill-founded beliefs about vaccination and reducing intentions to vaccinate. The implications for research on vaccines misinformation and recommendations for progress are discussed.\",\n",
       " 'Introduction:\\xa0Barriers to vaccination and the important role of healthcare professionals (HCPs) in influencing immunization decisions made by parents/patients have been well documented. Little information describes challenges that HCPs face in carrying out their role as vaccinators.Methods:\\xa0We conducted a focus group study asking HCPs to describe their expectations as frontline vaccinators versus the day-to-day reality they faced. Participants described challenges impacting their ability and motivation as vaccinators, and proposed key solutions to the most important challenges. A total of 75 nurses and physicians (sixteen groups of frontline vaccinators) from the United Kingdom, United States, Germany and India participated in 2 hour focus-group discussions.Results:\\xa0There was disconnect between how participants viewed their role in preserving population health when they started their career, and the reality of real-world practice today. Challenges experienced and reflected were similar across professional groups and countries. Low patient-level vaccine knowledge, patient miseducation, untimely vaccine information, frequently changing vaccine schedules, time pressures, lack of centralized record systems, pressure to achieve vaccination targets, and in some instances vaccine costs, all impacted the efficiency and enthusiasm of HCPs. Identified solutions by the same providers included improving patient-level information, equipping HCPs with effective information, and practical ways to reduce the vaccination burden by improved administrative processes and centralized recording coupled with delegating vaccinator roles.Conclusion:\\xa0This focus group gives unique insights into needs of HCPs to fulfill their role as vaccinators. Supporting and equipping vaccinators is critical to the continuing success of vaccination programs and the proposed life-course immunization strategy. (Supplementary Appendix 1).',\n",
       " 'Though once a discovery greatly celebrated by the nation, the vaccine has come under fire in recent decades from skeptics, critics, and a movement set into motion by fraudulent scientists and fueled by frustrated parents looking for answers to the autism conundrum. There is enough denialist resistance to vaccination to bring upon renewed fear of young children and infants becoming infected with diseases, the threats of which had been functionally eradicated from the United States. In more recent years, the surge in independent online journalism and blogging has invited many to rapidly share their opinions with millions of readers and, importantly, has appeared to open the door for opinion to be portrayed as fact. As a result, many parents are inundated with horror stories of vaccine dangers, all designed to eat away at them emotionally while the medical and scientific communities have mounted their characteristic response by sharing the facts, the data, and all of the reliable peer-reviewed and well-cited research to show that vaccines are safe and effective. It has become clear to me that facts are no match for emotion, but perhaps an understanding behind vaccine methodology will help parents overcome these fears of vaccinating. By helping those who doubt vaccines better understand what vaccines really are and how they work in such an incredibly engineered fashion, we may have a stronger weapon than we realize in battling the emotional arsenal that comes from the fear and skepticism of vaccinating.',\n",
       " \"While vaccination is one of the most successful public health interventions, there has always been a parallel movement against vaccines. Apart from scientific factors, the uptake of vaccinations is influenced by historical, political, sociocultural and economic factors. In India, the health system is struggling with logistical weaknesses in taking vaccination to the remotest corners; while on the other hand, some people in places where vaccination is available resist it. Unwillingness to be vaccinated is a growing problem in the developed world. This trend is gradually emerging in several parts of India as well. Other factors, such as heightened awareness of the profit motives of the vaccine industry, conflicts of interest among policy-makers, and social, cultural and religious considerations have eroded the people's trust in vaccination. This paper develops an analytical framework to assess trust in vaccination. The framework considers trust in vaccination from four perspectives - trust in the health system, the vaccine policy, vaccination providers and specific vaccines. The framework considers specific issues involved in vaccination trust, including the increasing scepticism towards medical technology, perceptions of conflicts of interest in the vaccine policy, and of lack of transparency and openness, the presence of strong alternative schools of thought, influence of the social media. The paper will conclude by arguing that engaging with communities and having a dialogue about the vaccination policy is an ethical imperative.\",\n",
       " 'Vaccines are typically injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly for stimulation of immune responses. The success of this requires efficient drainage of vaccine to lymph nodes where antigen presenting cells can interact with lymphocytes for generation of the wanted immune responses. The strength and the type of immune responses induced also depend on the density or frequency of interactions as well as the microenvironment, especially the content of cytokines. As only a minute fraction of peripherally injected vaccines reaches the lymph nodes, vaccinations of mice and humans were performed by direct injection of vaccine into inguinal lymph nodes, i.e. intralymphatic injection. In man, the procedure is guided by ultrasound. In mice, a small (5-10 mm) incision is made in the inguinal region of anesthetized animals, the lymph node is localized and immobilized with forceps, and a volume of 10-20 μl of the vaccine is injected under visual control. The incision is closed with a single stitch using surgical sutures. Mice were vaccinated with plasmid DNA, RNA, peptide, protein, particles, and bacteria as well as adjuvants, and strong improvement of immune responses against all type of vaccines was observed. The intralymphatic method of vaccination is especially appropriate in situations where conventional vaccination produces insufficient immunity or where the amount of available vaccine is limited.',\n",

       " 'Conventional equine influenza vaccination schedules consist of a primary course of two vaccinations given 4-6 weeks apart followed by a third vaccination (booster) given approximately 5 months later. In between the primary course and the third vaccination, horses are generally considered not to be adequately protected against influenza. This study aimed to investigate whether Thoroughbred foals would benefit from a vaccination schedule in which the third vaccination was given earlier than in conventional vaccination schedules. The vaccines used were an inactivated whole virus equine influenza vaccine and an inactivated whole virus combination vaccine containing equine influenza and equine herpesvirus antigens. Four groups of foals were vaccinated with the two vaccines according to a conventional and an accelerated vaccination schedule in which the third vaccination was given 14 weeks after the first administration. In both groups, the fourth vaccination was given at the normally recommended interval of 26 weeks after the third vaccination for the combination vaccine and 52 weeks after the third vaccination with the influenza only vaccine. The horses were 4-11 months of age and seronegative for influenza. Immunological responses after vaccination were monitored for several months using the single radial haemolysis test. The results indicated that 28 weeks after the first vaccination, antibody levels in horses vaccinated according to the accelerated schedule were not significantly higher than in horses vaccinated according to the conventional schedule. In addition, the total level of antibody production (area under the curve) was not significantly different at that point although antibody titres were slightly higher (but not significantly so) between 16-30 weeks in the accelerated schedule. Between the third and fourth doses, horses vaccinated according to the accelerated schedule had antibodies against influenza below the level required for clinical protection for 39 and 18 weeks for the influenza only and the combination vaccine, respectively, whereas those vaccinated according to the conventional schedule had antibody titres below the level for clinical protection for 9-15 weeks in the corresponding period for both vaccines. Horses vaccinated according to the accelerated schedule with the combination vaccine had lower antibody titres after the fourth vaccination than those vaccinated according to the conventional schedule after the third vaccination, although antibody titres prior to vaccination were similar. For the influenza only vaccine, titres after the accelerated fourth administration were not different to those after the conventional third vaccination. There was no benefit from early booster vaccinations with the vaccines used in this study, so for these vaccines the conventional schedule provided better protection than the selected accelerated alternative. This may contrast with some other vaccine formulations, although a direct comparison using similar protocols has not been made.',\n",
       " 'Vaccination is recommended throughout life to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases and their sequel. The primary focus of vaccination programs has historically been directed to childhood immunizations. For adults, chronic diseases have been the primary focus of preventive and medical health care, though there has been increased emphasis on preventing infectious diseases. Adult vaccination coverage, however, remains low for most of the routinely recommended vaccines. Though adults are less susceptible to fall prey to traditional infectious agents, the probability of exposure to infectious agents has increased manifold owing to globalization and increasing travel opportunities both within and across the countries. Thus, there is an urgent need to address the problem of adult immunization. The adult immunization enterprise is more complex, encompassing a wide variety of vaccines and a very diverse target population. There is no coordinated public health infrastructure to support an adult immunization program as there is for children. Moreover, there is little coordination among adult healthcare providers in terms of vaccine provision. Substantial improvement in adult vaccination is needed to reduce the health consequences of vaccine-preventable diseases among adults. Routine assessment of adult patient vaccination needs, recommendation, and offer of needed vaccines for adults should be incorporated into routine clinical care of adults.',\n",

A cross-sectional study was performed from December 2017 through March 2018 in the geographic area of Naples, Italy. The study used two stages cluster sampling method for selection and recruitment of participants. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews with pregnant women present at the Obstetrics outpatient clinic of the selected hospitals. A total of 358 respondents agreed to be interviewed out of the 405 pregnant women selected. One-fourth knew at least one of the vaccinations recommended during pregnancy and only 2.8% correctly identified all of these. Women who had received information about the vaccinations during pregnancy from general practitioners or gynecologists or other sources and those with at least one child were more likely to know at least one of the recommended vaccinations, whereas women with middle school education were less knowledgeable. None of the women had received tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine and only 1.4% the seasonal influenza vaccination. Only 27.9% reported a positive willingness to receive all the recommended vaccinations during pregnancy. Pregnant women would be willing to get all recommended vaccinations if they had at least one child and if they needed additional information, whereas the willingness was significantly lower among women who had reported high school as the highest level of education, who were in the second trimester of pregnancy, and who felt that the recommended vaccines administered during pregnancy were less dangerous for them and for the unborn child. This study suggests important focus points to be taking into account for informing and for implementing education activities on the benefits regarding vaccinations in order to increase the level of knowledge and the uptake in pregnant women.\",\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Early provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) reduced financial barriers to preventive care, including routinely recommended vaccines; however, vaccination coverage remains suboptimal. This study examined characteristics of routine adult vaccinations and potential missed opportunities for vaccinations through the lens of healthcare resource utilization among adults in the ACA era. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of healthcare claims from the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE), Medicare Supplemental (MS), and Multi-State Medicaid databases among adults aged 19\\xa0years or older. Influenza, Tdap (tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis), herpes zoster (HZ), and pneumococcal vaccinations were identified between 2011 and 2016. Potential missed opportunities were defined as well-visits at which individuals were age-eligible for vaccination but did not receive it, assessed during recommended windows for each vaccine. Missed encounters were defined as having no well-visits. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with vaccination and potential missed opportunities. RESULTS: Family/internal medicine and unknown/other providers administered most influenza, Tdap, and pneumococcal vaccinations, for the CCAE/MS and Medicaid cohorts, respectively. HZ vaccinations were primarily administered through pharmacies. The proportion of vaccination events increased in the pharmacy setting between 2011 and 2016. Having preventive care visits, non-well-visits, and receiving most care from a family/internal medicine practitioner were associated with increased odds of vaccination. Missed encounters were common in Medicaid enrollees. Potential missed opportunities were more prevalent in the CCAE/MS cohort than among Medicaid enrollees. Having non-well-visits was associated with a reduced likelihood of having a missed opportunity. CONCLUSION: Since the ACA implementation, preventive care among adults was sporadic. Many adults had limited opportunities for vaccination. The large prevalence of missed opportunities suggests vaccination uptake could be improved. Better support for vaccination or referrals for providers who may not traditionally vaccinate could improve vaccine uptake.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The inadequate knowledge about vaccinations of healthcare workers, including medical doctors, has certainly contributed to the spread of the vaccine hesitancy. Therefore, it is essential to improve the level of knowledge of future doctors. The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of a course about vaccinations on the knowledge of medical students. METHODS: Medical students were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire before and after a seminar on vaccination that they willingly attended. The two questionnaires contained the same 10 questions about vaccines. Only the students who had attended the lecture were allowed to fulfil the post-lecture questionnaires through the learning management system (LMS) called \"Moodle\". A descriptive statistical analysis of the data collected through the comparative evaluation of the answers before and after the seminar was performed. Mann-Whitney test for two independent samples was used to compare medians score before and after the interventions. RESULTS: A total of 100 medical students filled the pre-lecture questionnaire and 81 of them completed the post-lecture questionnaire. Knowledge of the students on the indication of the MMR (Measles-Mumps-Rubella) vaccine strongly improved after the seminar. Moreover, the number of students who would recommend vaccination for pertussis and influenza during pregnancy increased significantly by 37% and 19% respectively after the seminar and those aware of the need for Herpes Zoster vaccination over the age of 65 increased by 22%. DISCUSSION: For future doctors, a thorough knowledge about vaccinations is increasingly required in order to deal with vaccine hesitancy. Extracurricular seminars about vaccines, provided in the second half of the course of study, can have a highly positive impact.',\n",
       " \"This review deals briefly with some key developments in veterinary viral vaccinology, lists the types of vaccines that are used for vaccinations commonly performed in food animals as well as in companion animals, and indicates that the practising veterinarian can select the best vaccine by comparing the results of efficacy studies. Diva (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals; also termed marker) vaccines and companion diagnostic tests have been developed that can be used for progam aimed to control or eradicate virus infections. Vaccine-induced herd immunity, which can be measured relatively easily when diva vaccines are used, is a crucial issue in such programmes. Current vaccine research follows many routes towards novel vaccines, which can he divided into non-replicating ('killed') and replicating ('live') vaccines. Promising trends are the development of DNA vaccination, vector vaccines, and attenuation of DNA and RNA viruses by DNA technology. The lack of (in vitro) correlates of vaccine protection markedly hampers progress in vaccine research. Various characteristics of an 'ideal' vaccine are listed, such as multivalency and the induction of lifelong immunity after one non-invasive administration in animals with maternal immunity. Future research should he aimed at developing vaccines that approach the ideal as closely as possible and which are directed against diseases not yet controlled by vaccination and against newly emerging diseases.\",\n",

The purpose of the study is to specify the arguments and methods of circulation of anti-vaccination propaganda and to find out scientific counterarguments. Actually, there is sufficient data concerning lack of confidence to vaccination and vaccine prevention of infectious diseases. The systematic qualitative review of publications on issues of interest was carried out. It is established that lack of confidence to vaccination is maintained artificially and can be characterized as an information virus. The information throw-ins of fake-news about danger of vaccine and harm of vaccination undermine population trust to health care and vaccine prevention. The problem continues to be actual and controversial. So, every individual is independently to determine one's attitude to vaccination and to take charge of one's own health. Also, a number of facts is presented refuting convictions of anti-vaccinators.\",\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVE: Despite increases in routine vaccination coverage during the past three decades, the percent of children completing the recommended vaccination schedule remains below expected targets in many low and middle income countries. In 2008, the World Health Organization Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization requested more information on the reasons that children were under-vaccinated (receiving at least one but not all recommended vaccinations) or not vaccinated in order to develop effective strategies and interventions to reach these children. METHODS: A systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature published from 1999 to 2009 was conducted to aggregate information on reasons and factors related to the under-vaccination and non-vaccination of children. A standardized form was used to abstract information from relevant articles identified from eight different medical, behavioural and social science literature databases. FINDINGS: Among 202 relevant articles, we abstracted 838 reasons associated with under-vaccination; 379 (45%) were related to immunization systems, 220 (26%) to family characteristics, 181 (22%) to parental attitudes and knowledge, and 58 (7%) to limitations in immunization-related communication and information. Of the 19 reasons abstracted from 11 identified articles describing the non-vaccinated child, 6 (32%) were related to immunization systems, 8 (42%) to parental attitudes and knowledge, 4 (21%) to family characteristics, and 1 (5%) to communication and information. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple reasons for under-vaccination and non-vaccination were identified, indicating that a multi-faceted approach is needed to reach under-vaccinated and unvaccinated children. Immunization system issues can be addressed through improving outreach services, vaccine supply, and health worker training; however, under-vaccination and non-vaccination linked to parental attitudes and knowledge are more difficult to address and likely require local interventions.',\n",
       " 'The European Union (EU) currently has 27 Member States, each with its own history, characteristics and habits. The National Health Services of most of these countries have different vaccination systems, different vaccine recommendations and different schedules of vaccine administration, which means that immunization is not considered in the same way and, at least for some antigens, vaccination coverage does not always meet changing medical needs. Together with a lack of political will concerning prevention in childhood, a poor understanding or false perceptions on the part of the general public (and even healthcare workers), and the inadequacies and heterogeneity of the vaccination systems can all be considered barriers to vaccinations in Europe. The most important limitations are those relating to the evaluation of vaccination coverage, the lack of active reminder systems to pick up patients who miss appointments, and the monitoring of adverse events. A common programme designed to overcome these limitations could be beneficial in promoting vaccinations everywhere, above all because active measures by the Health Authorities to demonstrate the importance they attribute to vaccination could convince still uncertain parents to have their children vaccinated.',\n",
       " \"The global reduction in childhood infectious diseases since the 1960s is primarily due to the success of extensive worldwide immunisation campaigns. However, the universal vaccination coverage program appears to have lost momentum in the wake of negative, unfounded claims about the safety of vaccines. While parents of the 21st century have little first-hand knowledge of devastating childhood diseases, grandparents are more likely to remember family and community members who were afflicted. In the current age of vaccine hesitancy and science scepticism, where research-informed arguments are not always persuasive, grandparents, through their experience of the diseases, may positively influence paediatric vaccine uptake. This paper reviews the literature investigating potential direct or indirect influences of grandparents on parents' decisions to vaccinate their children. A database search using the keywords immunisation, vaccination, children and grandparents resulted in 1988 articles. Titles were screened for relevance and seventy-seven results were retained. After the abstracts were read, only five articles that either explored paediatric vaccines, factors promoting and/or inhibiting paediatric vaccine use and decision-making strategies were reviewed. One paper located through Google Scholar, which failed to show up on database searches, was also retained for a total of six papers. While none of the six papers set out to explore the impact of grandparents on vaccine uptake, they found that grandparents were involved to varying degrees in paediatric vaccine uptake within young families. The research clearly showing that grandparents, and older people more generally, promote vaccination uptake is not currently available. The dearth of literature shows the need for research exploring the perceived and real influences of grandparents on childhood vaccination. This will establish whether grandparents' memory and knowledge of preventable childhood infectious diseases could be harnessed as a public health measure to counteract the current, ill-informed, negative attention on paediatric vaccines.\",\n",
       " \"Immunization during pregnancy is a simple and effective way to protect the mother and child from certain infections. The immunological changes occur during pregnancy which may be responsible for the susceptibility of certain infectious diseases that increases the risk of more serious outcomes. Vaccination of pregnant women can protect to mother against vaccine-preventable infections, and in so doing potentially protect the fetus. Immunization during pregnancy can also directly protect the fetus and infant via transferred of antibodies from the mother to the fetus. This is why vaccinations during pregnancy are so important. Vaccination during pregnancy is a cost-effective strategy to improve pregnancy outcomes in India. Globally, no scientific study exist which shows the risk of fetus after vaccination of pregnant women with inactivated vaccines or bacterial vaccines or toxoids. Even live vaccines causing risk to fetus is theoretical. Vaccination with inactivated virus, bacterial or toxoid in pregnancy is risk to a developing fetus during pregnancy is theoretical. But definitely the live vaccine poses a theoretical risk to a developing fetus. Therefore, all live vaccines should be avoided during pregnancy. The developing country like India where the people can't afford these vaccines, the government should be included these vaccines in routine immunization program.\",\n",
       " 'Amid provider reports of financial barriers as an impediment to adult immunization, this study explores the time and costs of vaccination in adult provider practices. Both a Vaccination Time-Motion Study and Vaccine Practice Management Survey were conducted (March - October 2017) in a convenience sample of 19 family medicine (FM), internal medicine (IM), and obstetrician-gynecology (OBGYN) practices, in nine states. Practices were directly observed during a one week period; estimates were collected of time spent on activities that could not be directly observed. Cost estimates were calculated by converting staff time for performed activities. In the time-motion study, FM and IM practices spent similar time conducting vaccination activities (median\\u202f=\\u202f5\\u202fmin per vaccination), while OBGYN practices spent more time (median\\u202f=\\u202f29\\u202fmin per vaccination). Combining results from the time-motion study and the practice management survey, the median costs of vaccination remained similar for FM practices and IM practices at $7 and $8 per vaccination, respectively, but was substantially higher for OBGYN practices at $43 per vaccination. Factors that contributed to higher costs among OBGYN practices were the increased time to counsel patients, administer vaccines, and to plan and manage vaccine supplies. In addition, 68% of OBGYN patients who were offered and counseled to receive vaccines declined to receive them. Counseling patients who ultimately do not go on to receive a vaccine may be an important cost factor. Lower costs of vaccination services may be achieved by increasing efficiencies in workflow or the volume of vaccinations.',\n",

French coverage is considerably lower than figures published in the USA and Belgium. Vaccine strategies are specific to adolescence with regard to the location of vaccines, the vaccination decision, the vaccinator. The GP is the principal actor in the vaccine. Teenagers have largely favorable opinion about vaccination. The schedule is simple in adolescence.

       " 'During the influenza vaccination campaign 2014-2015, the reporting of 3 deaths within 48\\xa0hours of vaccination with Fluad brought the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) to pronounce the withdrawal of 2 batches of vaccine, based on the precautionary principle. Investigations by the Italian National Institute of Health, and by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), the committee at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) responsible for monitoring and assessing the safety profiles of human drugs, concluded that there was a lack of causality between the reported deaths and the vaccines administered. However, the media impact of the decision taken by AIFA, resulted in a lower influenza vaccination coverage compared with the previous years. The aim of our study was to identify possible critical points that may have led to a non-perfect management of the event. A review of the regulatory framework in place was performed, with a particular focus on the Guidelines on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices developed by the EMA to facilitate the signal management process. The management of reports involves the following steps: signal detection, its validation and confirmation, analysis and prioritization, assessment, recommendations for action and the exchange of information. In our opinion, both the signal detection phase and the phase of validation have been critical: the withdrawal of vaccine batches is possible even in case of a single suspected serious adverse reaction. However, aspects such as the biological plausibility, the presence of potential alternative causes and previous awareness should also be considered. Furthermore, the number of reported deaths was consistent with the expected background mortality rate in the vaccinated cohort. The disproportionate media coverage given to the AIFA decision resulted in a reduced vaccine confidence in the general population and in a decreased immunization coverage. Improving the communication on vaccine safety issues is crucial at this stage to restore a climate of trust in this powerful tool for primary prevention.',\n",
       " \"Some important vaccinations are not included in the routine childhood immunization schedule in Japan. Voluntary vaccinations are usually paid as an out-of-pocket expense. Low voluntary vaccination coverage rates and high target disease incidence are assumed to be a consequence of voluntary vaccination. Therefore, this study aimed to explore factors associated with voluntary vaccination patterns in children. We conducted an online survey of 1243 mothers from a registered survey panel who had at least one child 2 months to <3 years of age. The voluntary vaccination mainly correlated positively with annual household income and mothers' positive opinions about voluntary vaccinations, but negatively with number of children. Financial support, especially for low income households and households with more than one child, may motivate parents to vaccinate their children. Communication is also an important issue. More opportunities for education and information about voluntary vaccinations should be provided to mothers without distinguishing between voluntary and routine vaccination.\",\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: To address public concern about the safety of the childhood immunization schedule, the Institute of Medicine recommended observational studies comparing adverse health outcomes of fully vaccinated children to children under-vaccinated due to parental choice. Misclassification of vaccination status could bias such studies. OBJECTIVE: To assess risk of misclassification of vaccination status within the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). DESIGN/METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in three phases. In phase 1, electronic health record (EHR) data were used to identify patterns of under-vaccination during the first 24months of life potentially due to parental choice. In phase 2, a random sample of records of under-vaccinated children was manually reviewed. In phase 3, a separate sample of parents were surveyed to assess whether EHR data accurately reflected their child's vaccination status. Phases 1 and 2 were conducted at 6 VSD sites, phase 3 at 1 site. RESULTS: The study cohort included 361,901 children born 2004 through 2012. By 24months of age, 198,249 (54.8%) were fully vaccinated with no delays, 84,698 (23.4%) experienced delays but were fully vaccinated by 24months of age, 4865 (1.3%) received no vaccines, 3789 (1.0%) delayed starting vaccination until ≥4months of age, 4781 (1.3%) had consistent vaccine-limiting (≤2 vaccines per visit), and the remaining 65,519 (18.1%) were missing vaccine series or doses. When a diagnosis code for vaccine refusal was present in EHR data, encounter notes confirmed vaccine refusal as the reason for under-vaccination for nearly 100% of sampled records. Parent surveys confirmed these findings. Parents of under-vaccinated children were more likely to report visiting an alternative medical provider than parents of fully vaccinated children. CONCLUSIONS: Specific groups of children, under-vaccinated due to parental choice, can be identified with relatively low likelihood of misclassification of vaccination status using EHR-based vaccine data and diagnosis codes.\",\n",
       " \"INTRODUCTION: Vaccine recommendations are the same for healthcare students than for other health care workers. The aim of this study was to describe mandatory and recommended vaccinal coverage and evaluate the benefit of systematic monitoring by a medical team in the Lille Medical School. POPULATION AND METHODS: A survey was performed from June 2011 to August 2011 on all students in the first year of Health Care Studies. The personal immunization record was considered as evidence of vaccination. The reference vaccinal schedule was the one recommended by the French High Council for Public Health in 2011. RESULTS: We analyzed the personal immunization records of 553 students. The vaccination coverage was 96.7% (535) for DTP, 74.7% (413) for hepatitis B, and 92.2% (510) of the students had a tuberculin test result. Concerning the recommended vaccinations, 78% (431) were covered for measles, and 78.9% (436) had a history of either chickenpox or its immunization. About 72.7% (402) of students were vaccinated for Haemophilus influenzae and Bordetella pertussis. Respectively, 24.2% (134) and 81% (448) had previously been vaccinated for Neisseria meningitis and tuberculosis. The monitoring of students allowed improving hepatitis B vaccination coverage by 22.28% (123). The student's vaccinal coverage was still inadequate for hepatitis B and measles. The systematic monitoring allowed significantly improving vaccinal coverage for hepatitis B.\",\n",
       " 'The role of healthcare workers in life-long vaccination is very important in the means of 2 sided infection, rising patient awareness and being a role model for the patients. Numerous organizations publish guidelines for vaccination of HCWs, while healthcare facilities develop vaccination policies according to the accreditation standards. Nevertheless, vaccination rates among HCWs are far below targets. The obstacles to getting vaccinated or recommending vaccination may include rather universal factors such as the vaccine paradox, however in the case of HCWs, probably a different set of factors are included. The aims of this article are to gain an overview of vaccination strategies for HCWs, to assess the coverage rates of HCWs and make in-depth analyses of the potential barriers to vaccination and potential factors to motivate HCWs for vaccination in Turkey and to compare them with the global picture to improve implementation of policies concerning vaccination of HCWs.',\n",

       " 'The aim of this study is to evaluate the vaccination coverage at 24 months of chronological age in a sample of preterm infants discharged by the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the Bari Policlinico University General Hospital in Italy. The list of infants preterm born discharged during 2013 by the NICU was obtained by hospital database. Vaccination status of each subject at 24 months of chronological age was acquired by the Apulian Regional Vaccination Register (GIAVA). 159 preterm borns were enrolled in this study. 98.1% received the 1st dose of hexavalent vaccine and 98.7% the 1st dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The 8.8% of hexavalent vaccinations were performed during hospitalization. The percentage of immunized subjects decreased to 91.2% and 87.3% for the 2nd and 3rd dose of hexavalent vaccine and to 90.6% and 86.1% for the 2nd and 3rd dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Coverage for MMR, MEN C and Varicella vaccines were, respectively 76.4%, 86.0% and 80.9%. Pre-terms received the vaccinations later than the age recommended by public health guidelines. Age at the immunization, for all vaccines, seems to increase for lower gestational age and birth weight and for higher length of hospitalization. This study shows a high risk of vaccine delay among pre-terms born. There is a strong need to improve specific vaccination strategies for this group. Neonatologists might play a key role in informing parents about the vaccination schedule at the moment of NICU discharge and during follow-up, also preparing correct time schedule.',\n",

METHODS: From January to April 2016, 304 adults in Guinea were presented with 48 vignettes depicting situations in which getting vaccinated would be possible. These situations varied as a function of the constructs of health-protective behavior theories. The participants indicated the likelihood they would get vaccinated in each case. RESULTS: Seven qualitatively different positions were found: Always Vaccinate (38%), Never Vaccinate (25%), Hesitant (19%), Depends on Cost Only (7%), Depends on Neighbors\\' Attitude and Cost (5%), Mainly Depends on Risk (4%), and Mistrust of Cheap Vaccines (2%). CONCLUSION: The diversity of Guinean people\\'s positions implies that Ebola vaccination campaigns in Guinea, and probably in other sub-Saharan African countries, must not be \"one size fits all,\" but must be multifaceted and tailored in design and implementation to match the diversity of these people\\'s needs and views.',\n",
       " 'None of the original vaccines used in the child immunization programmes in low-income countries, including BCG, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), oral polio vaccine (OPV), and measles vaccine (MV), were tested for their overall effect on child mortality before being introduced. It was assumed that the effect on overall child mortality would be equivalent to the proportion of deaths caused by the targeted disease(s) (1). However, this is no longer a tenable assumption. Many studies have shown that these routine vaccines may have more general effects on the immune system than merely protecting against the targeted disease, i.e. so-called non-specific effects (NSE) (2). The NSE may well be more important for overall child survival than the lives saved by specific disease prevention (2-4). The WHO´s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) has recently stated that it will keep a watch on the non-specific effects (NSE) of vaccination. GACVS indicated that \"conclusive evidence for or against non-specific effects of vaccines on mortality, including a potential deleterious effect of DTP vaccination on children\\'s survival as has been reported in some studies, was unlikely to be obtained from observational studies\" (5). By insisting on new RCTs to provide conclusive evidence, GACVS is making it very difficult if not impossible to test the NSEs of the currently recommended vaccines. It would usually be considered unethical to test currently recommended vaccines as part of a trial withholding these vaccines from some children (6).',\n",
       " \"OBJECTIVES: In 2012, Ontario pharmacists were granted immunization privileges to administer influenza vaccines to the public. This study explored the experiences and practices of pharmacist vaccinators and the impact of vaccination pain on their practice. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 pharmacists in the Greater Toronto Area. Transcribed interview data were coded and analyzed via thematic analysis. KEY FINDINGS: Data analysis revealed 4 main themes: 1) expanded scope of practice as an enhancement and challenge to relationships; 2) professional satisfaction and workload demands; 3) knowledge and attitudes regarding pain and fear; 4) practices regarding pain and fear management. Pharmacists reported satisfaction in their new role, despite the associated increased workload. Pharmacists felt that vaccination pain was not a key consideration when administering vaccines and that pain management was generally not necessary. Fear was identified as more important than pain and vaccinating children was challenging and time intensive. Pharmacists' main focus was on injection techniques in managing pain. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that pharmacists are accepting of their role as vaccinators but more research is needed to examine impact on workload and pharmacist knowledge and perceptions of injection-related pain and fear.\",\n",
       " 'David Ropiek in his useful essay on how society should respond to the risks created by those who choose not to vaccinate themselves or their children does a very useful job of identifying the enormous costs in money and health that non-vaccinators create. He also pinpoints the many factors that drive vaccine resistance locating them not in a misunderstanding of the facts but, in fears and negative emotions. It is important to pay attention to his message since frequently those who want to try to reduce vaccine hesitation or outright non-vaccination behavior put their faith in education and resort to an invocation of the facts about the value of vaccines when it is fear and emotions that must be addressed.',\n",
       " 'WHO defines adolescence age between 10 to 19 years. In India, there are 243 million adolescents which constitute 21 per cent of the total population. The global burden of disease in adolescents (2011) reports that the total number of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide among adolescents were 230 million which constitutes 15.5% of total DALYs. The immunization is one of the most important, most beneficial and cost-effective disease prevention measures that can be provided for adolescents. The adolescent vaccination protects most of the world\\'s adolescents from a number of infectious diseases that previously claimed millions of lives each year. In India, thousands of adolescents die and thousands are hospitalized every year due to communicable diseases that could have been prevented by vaccination. Main aims of adolescent vaccinations are: to boost immunity status that is waning after completion of primary immunization or absence of \"natural\" boosting due exposure to the particular disease. The recommendations for the immunization of adolescents are to improve vaccination coverage among them. The adolescent vaccinations also help in accelerate disease control or elimination effort. Improvement in adolescent immunization coverage in India, will require strengthening of health care delivery system and also require significant improvements in the health care functionaries ability and willingness to provide and deliver vaccines to adolescents.',\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: While immunization is one of the most effective and successful public health interventions, there are still up to 30,000 deaths in major developed economies each year due to vaccine-preventable diseases, almost all in adults. In the UK, despite comparatively high vaccination rates among ≥65 s (73%) and, to a lesser extent, at-risk ≤65 s (52%) in 2013/2014, over 10,000 excess deaths were reported the previous influenza season. Adult tetanus vaccines are not routinely recommended in the UK, but may be overly administered. Social influences and risk-perceptions of diseases and vaccines are known to affect vaccine uptake. We aimed to explore the socio-psychological factors that drive adult vaccination in the UK, specifically influenza and tetanus, and to evaluate whether these factors are comparable between vaccines. METHODS: 20 in-depth, face-to-face interviews were conducted with members of the UK public who represented a range of socio-demographic characteristics associated with vaccination uptake. We employed qualitative interviewing approaches to reach a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing adult vaccination decisions. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Participants were classified according to their vaccination status as regular, intermittent and non-vaccinators for influenza, and preventative, injury-led, mixed (both preventative and injury-led) and as non-vaccinators for tetanus. We present our finding around five overarching themes: 1) perceived health and health behaviors; 2) knowledge; 3) vaccination influences; 4) disease appraisal; and 5) vaccination appraisal. CONCLUSION: The uptake of influenza and tetanus vaccines was largely driven by participants' risk perception of these diseases. The tetanus vaccine is perceived as safe and sufficiently tested, whereas the changing composition of the influenza vaccine is a cause of uncertainty and distrust. To maximize the public health impact of adult vaccines, policy should be better translated into high vaccination rates through evidence-based implementation approaches.\",\n",

The aim of this work is to provide a quantitative analysis on the type of information available to Italian people regarding vaccination and a quality analysis of websites retrieved through our searches. A quality score was created to evaluate the technical level of websites. A research was performed through Yahoo, Google, and MSN using the keywords \"vaccine\" and \"vaccination,\" with the function \"OR\" in order to identify the most frequently used websites. The 2 keywords were input in Italian, and the first 15 pages retrieved by each search engine were analyzed. 149 websites were selected through this methodology. Fifty-three per cent of the websites belonged to associations, groups, or scientific companies, 32.2% (n = 48) consisted of a personal blog and 14.8% (n = 22) belonged to some of the National Health System offices. Among all analyzed websites, 15.4% (n = 23) came from anti-vaccine movement groups. 37.6% reported webmaster name, 67.8% webmaster e-mail, 28.6% indicated the date of the last update and 46.6% the author\\'s name. The quality score for government sites was higher on average than anti-vaccine websites; although, government sites don\\'t use Web 2.0 functions, as the forums.: National Health System institutions who have to promote vaccination cannot avoid investing in web communication because it cannot be managed by private efforts but must be the result of Public Health, private and scientific association, and social movement synergy.',\n",
       " 'In order to contribute to the discussion of compulsory vaccinations a brief review of those vaccines that have been extensively used so far is presented. Such review reflects the urgency to update the vaccine schedule presently in use in our country, following WHO recommendations. In Italy, hepatitis B vaccination will soon be made compulsory by law for all newborns and children at the age of 12. As far as measles, mumps and rubella are concerned there is no universal agreement on whether to vaccinate the newborns or not because there is a theoretical risk of delaying the occurrence of these infections to a later age. Such risk could be easily reduced by allowing for booster doses of vaccine at the beginning of primary school. Only pilot studies would provide evidence on the effectiveness of the new vaccines for whooping cough and varicella-zoster and on the opportunity of vaccinating newborns for these infections. For all the others available and experimental vaccines it is too early to consider their inclusion among the compulsory vaccines although the rapid pace of the research in this field makes it quite likely that vaccination schedule will be soon extended.',\n",
       " \"Vaccinating premature and low birthweight (LBW) infants according to chronological age has been found safe and effective.

Vaccinations included Hepatitis B, Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis-IPV-Haemophilus influenzae B, Oral Polio Bivalent, Rotavirus, Pneumococcal Conjugate, Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Varicella and Hepatitis A. Inclusion criteria: (1) born in Israel; (2) having a unique identifier (allowing data matching); and (3) surviving to 24\\xa0months. VC at 24\\xa0months and timeliness of vaccine doses were evaluated according to infants' birthweight (BW) and gestational age (GA). Preterm infants (GA < 37\\xa0weeks) comprised 7.0% (n\\xa0=\\xa012,264); LBW infants (BW< 2500\\xa0g) were 7.7% (n\\xa0=\\xa013,950); BW was 1500-2499\\xa0g in 6.8%, 1000-1499\\xa0g in 0.6% and below 1000\\xa0g in 0.3%. Compared to normal birthweight (NBW) infants (BW≥2500\\xa0g), LBW infants showed delayed initiation of vaccinations. Odds ratio (OR) for delay: DTaP-IPV-Hib 1 OR\\xa0=\\xa01.26 [95%CI 1.19-1.33]; Rota 1, OR\\xa0=\\xa01.22 [95%CI 1.16-1.29]. Vaccination delay rates were higher among smaller new-borns (below 1000\\xa0g). At 24\\xa0months there was no significant difference regarding vaccination status. This national cohort VC analysis focused on preterm/LBW infants. Vaccinating preterm and LBW infants according to the recommended schedule induces protection against life-threatening infectious diseases. Vaccination initiation among LBW infants showed considerable delay. Health practitioners and parents should cooperate to improve timely vaccination initiation.\",\n",

RESULTS: The updated official recommendations were considered as the reference document for both populations. The study did not reveal any hesitation or lack of information, which could explain the low hepatitis B vaccinal coverage.

We then analyzed the results through basic statistical calculations and Pearson's chi-squared tests. RESULTS: Seventy-four people (6.6%) responded to the survey, and 75% of responders stated that they administer all Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended vaccines. The lowest vaccine administration rates were for the high-dose influenza vaccine, which 66.2% (n\\xa0=\\xa049) of respondents reported to administer, followed by the meningococcal B vaccine (68.9%; n =\\xa051). The respondents who belonged to practices with more than 11 providers, were part of a large hospital or healthcare system, had electronic medical records (EMRs), and used the California Immunization Registry (CAIR) were more likely to report to vaccinate. The number one responding physician-reported challenge to vaccination was limited time and resources to address patient resistance followed by vaccine cost and lack of infrastructure to store vaccines.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is associated with significant infant morbidity and mortality. A prophylactic vaccine to prevent congenital CMV infection is expected to be available in the near future, and will likely be targeted to adolescent females. METHODS: Using a decision tree, we compared the costs, potential clinical impacts, and cost-effectiveness of the current strategy of no CMV vaccination versus a strategy where all adolescent females are vaccinated against CMV prior to their first pregnancy. Both maternal outcomes related to vaccination, and infant outcomes related to congenital CMV infection, were considered in the model. RESULTS: Under base-case conditions, our analysis suggested that vaccinating all adolescent females against cytomegalovirus would be both less costly and with greater clinical benefits than not vaccinating. Among a population of 100,000 adolescent females, the vaccination strategy cost $32.3 million dollars less than not vaccinating, and avoided substantial numbers of infants affected with hearing loss, vision loss, and mental retardation, and 8 infant deaths. Our model was most sensitive to variations in vaccine efficacy. When vaccine efficacy against disease was less than 61%, not vaccinating became the preferred strategy because it was less expensive than vaccinating, without substantial changes in clinical benefits to the population. CONCLUSIONS: Under a wide variety of conditions, universal vaccination of adolescent females to protect their future children against congenital CMV infection was cost effective. However, for this to be preferred over not vaccinating, our results suggest that vaccine efficacy against disease would need to be at least 61%.',\n",
       " \"PROBLEM/CONDITION: Overall, the prevalence of illness attributable to vaccine-preventable diseases is greater among adults than among children. Adults are recommended to receive vaccinations based on their age, underlying medical conditions, lifestyle, prior vaccinations, and other considerations. Updated vaccination recommendations from CDC are published annually in the U.S. Adult Immunization Schedule. Despite longstanding recommendations for use of many vaccines, vaccination coverage among U.S. adults is low. REPORTING PERIOD: August 2013-June 2014 (for influenza vaccination) and January-December 2014 (for pneumococcal, tetanus and diphtheria [Td] and tetanus and diphtheria with acellular pertussis [Tdap], hepatitis A, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, and human papillomavirus [HPV] vaccination). DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a continuous, cross-sectional national household survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population. In-person interviews are conducted throughout the year in a probability sample of households, and NHIS data are compiled and released annually. The survey objective is to monitor the health of the U.S. population and provide estimates of health indicators, health care use and access, and health-related behaviors. RESULTS: Compared with data from the 2013 NHIS, increases in vaccination coverage occurred for Tdap vaccine among adults aged ≥19 years (a 2.9 percentage point increase to 20.1%) and herpes zoster vaccine among adults aged ≥60 years (a 3.6 percentage point increase to 27.9%). Aside from these modest improvements, vaccination coverage among adults in 2014 was similar to estimates from 2013 (for influenza coverage, similar to the 2012-13 season). Influenza vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥19 years was 43.2%. Pneumococcal vaccination coverage among high-risk persons aged 19-64 years was 20.3% and among adults aged ≥65 years was 61.3%. Td vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥19 years was 62.2%. Hepatitis A vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥19 years was 9.0%. Hepatitis B vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥19 years was 24.5%. HPV vaccination coverage among adults aged 19-26 years was 40.2% for females and 8.2% for males. Racial/ethnic differences in coverage persisted for all seven vaccines, with higher coverage generally for whites compared with most other groups. Adults without health insurance were significantly less likely than those with health insurance to report receipt of influenza vaccine (aged ≥19 years), pneumococcal vaccine (aged 19-64 years with high-risk conditions and aged ≥65 years), Td vaccine (aged ≥19 years), Tdap vaccine (aged ≥19 years and 19-64 years), hepatitis A vaccine (aged ≥19 years overall and among travelers), hepatitis B vaccine (aged ≥19 years, 19-49 years, and 19-59 years with diabetes), herpes zoster vaccine (aged ≥60 years and 60-64 years), and HPV vaccine (females aged 19-26 years and males aged 19-26 years). Adults who reported having a usual place for health care generally were more likely to receive recommended vaccinations than those who did not have a usual place for health care, regardless of whether they had health insurance. Vaccination coverage was significantly higher among those reporting one or more physician contacts in the past year compared with those who had not visited a physician in the past year, regardless of whether they had health insurance. Even among adults who had health insurance and ≥10 physician contacts within the past year, 23.8%-88.8% reported not having received vaccinations that were recommended either for all persons or for those with some specific indication. Overall, vaccination coverage among U.S.-born respondents was significantly higher than that of foreign-born respondents with few exceptions (influenza vaccination [adults aged 19-49 years], hepatitis A vaccination [adults aged ≥19 years], hepatitis B vaccination [adults with diabetes aged ≥60 years], and HPV vaccination [males aged 19-26 years]). INTERPRETATION: Overall, increases in adult vaccination coverage are needed. Although modest gains occurred in Tdap vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥19 years and herpes zoster vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥60 years, coverage for other vaccines and risk groups did not improve, and racial/ethnic disparities persisted for routinely recommended adult vaccines. Coverage for all vaccines for adults remained low, and missed opportunities to vaccinate adults continued. Although having health insurance coverage and a usual place for health care are associated with higher vaccination coverage, these factors alone do not assure optimal adult vaccination coverage. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: Assessing associations with vaccination is important for understanding factors that contribute to low coverage rates and to disparities in vaccination, and for implementing strategies to improve vaccination coverage. Practices that have been demonstrated to improve vaccination coverage should be used. These practices include assessment of patients' vaccination indications by health care providers and routine recommendation and offer of needed vaccines to adults, implementation of reminder-recall systems, use of standing-order programs for vaccination, and assessment of practice-level vaccination rates with feedback to staff members. For vaccination to be improved among those least likely to be up-to-date on recommended adult vaccines, efforts also are needed to identify adults who do not have a regular provider or insurance and who report fewer health care visits.\",\n",
       " 'Participatory research on vaccination of village poultry against Newcastle disease (ND) was carried out in the village of Disaneng, in the North West Province of South Africa. Three application methods for ND Inkukhu vaccine were shown to induce sufficient levels of immunity in back-yard poultry when correctly administered. These are eye-droplet administration to individual fowls, in-feed and in-water administration to small flocks. After a community meeting and group discussion to select methods of vaccination, only 2 of the 3 methods were chosen; the individual administration of droplets into the eyes was considered to be too impractical because back-yard fowls are difficult to catch. Visual and practical training material was prepared and presented to volunteer vaccinators (n = 23). Vaccinators were then required to register all the poultry owners in their ward who wished to have poultry vaccinated. Once an indication of the number of chickens to be vaccinated had been made available, ND Nobilis Inkukhu vaccine was supplied to vaccinators free of charge. Community vaccinators were responsible for the organisation of the vaccination campaign, including storage and preparation of vaccine for application. All 9 wards in the village were initially involved with a total of 482 households, owning 6141 chickens, participating. This represented slightly in excess of 60 % of the fowls in the area. Involvement in a 2nd round of vaccinations, 1 month later, was far poorer with only 211 households owning a total of 1636 chickens participating. Serum samples were collected from vaccinated fowls using systematic random sampling and tested for circulating antibodies. The levels of protection varied, with no significant difference found between in-feed and in-water vaccine administration. Volunteer vaccinators were found to be unreliable, easily demotivated, did not keep good records and left the project when offered permanent employment. Contacting them to make arrangements for delivering vaccine was difficult and time consuming. Structured interviews indicated that deaths in poultry and the attitude of the owners probably contributed to the demotivation of the volunteers used as community vaccinators. It was concluded that volunteers are not the ideal choice for vaccination of village poultry against Newcastle disease.',\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: In recent years, pediatric immunization rates in Italy have decreased well below the recommended thresholds, largely due to an increase in scepticism about the efficacy and safety of vaccines. We aimed to identify the degree of such scepticism, and the factors driving it, among a sample of pregnant women in the City of Rome. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey on a sample of pregnant women attending antenatal classes (CANs) in Rome through distribution of a self-administered questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression models were built to analyze the determinants of knowledge, attitudes and intention to vaccinate in this population. RESULTS: A total of 458 pregnant women attending CANs in 36 family health centers and two hospitals in Rome answered the survey. Mean age was 32.9 (±5.0) years, and over 90% of women were in their first pregnancy. More than 26% of respondents showed a good level of knowledge of the safety and efficacy of vaccines, but there were high rates of uncertainty or agreement with some of the most common anti-vaccination sentiments. Only 75% of women were sure about vaccinating their children with the hexavalent vaccine, and 64.3% with MMR. A good level of knowledge was the strongest predictor of positive attitudes towards vaccination (OR 11.61, 95% CI 6.43-20.96), which, in turn, influenced the intention to vaccinate for most vaccines with the perception of the benefit of immunization for protection against disease. CONCLUSIONS: Scepticism about the safety, efficacy and importance of vaccines is associated to pregnant women's hesitancy to vaccinate their children, suggesting the need to develop strategies to increase vaccine acceptance in the antenatal period. The capacity of health care professionals, particularly midwives, to correctly deliver information to future parents should be strengthened in order to reduce the spread of misinformation and fear of vaccine safety.\",\n",

Computer-assisted web interviews were conducted with married women in their 20s-40s of South Korean, Chinese, or Japanese nationality (n = 1,571). Dependent variables were generated for the following four vaccinations: BCG, diphtheria+pertussis+tetanus (DPT), poliomyelitis (polio), and measles. For statistical processing, cases where all four types of vaccines had been recorded were scored as 1 and other cases were processed as 0. According to the results of the pooled model, we found that for East Asian mothers, decisional authority, self-efficacy, and health literacy all increased the likelihood that they would vaccinate their children. Furthermore, women who searched for health information through media such as the radio were more likely to vaccinate their children. However, when elaborate analyses were conducted by country, there were considerable differences in those characteristics by country. Therefore, this study showed that it is necessary to establish locally tailored strategies in order to raise vaccination rates in the Global Vaccine Action Plan. This study also showed that social contexts must be taken into consideration in order to raise vaccination rates.\",\n",
       " 'This study evaluated physician practices and perceived barriers for influenza, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap), and zoster vaccination of adults in the United States (US), with emphasis on patients with Medicare versus commercial insurance. A cross-sectional internet-based survey of board-certified general/family practitioners and internists (N\\xa0=\\xa01,000) recruited from a national US physician panel was conducted in May 2017. For influenza, rates of physician recommendation (84% of Medicare patients, 82% of commercially-insured patients), administration (80% Medicare, 78% commercial), and referral (11% Medicare, 11% commercial) were similar regardless of insurance type. Tdap recommendation was higher for commercial compared to Medicare patients (59% vs. 54%, p <\\xa00.001); while zoster recommendation was higher for Medicare patients than commercial (59% vs. 55%, p <\\xa00.001). For Tdap and zoster, higher administration rates were reported in commercial patients (64% Tdap, 36% zoster) than Medicare (56% Tdap, 32% zoster), and referral rates were higher for Medicare patients (19% Tdap, 49% zoster) than commercial (14% Tdap, 42% zoster). Over 40% of physicians would be much more likely to administer Tdap and zoster vaccines if they were covered under Medicare Part B, with more physicians indicating financial barriers as \"major\" or \"moderate\" for Medicare than commercial patients. These differences may be related to financial barriers associated with adult vaccinations that are covered under Medicare Part D and involve patient out-of-pocket costs. Efforts to reduce financial barriers associated with adult vaccinations covered under Medicare Part D and to improve patient and physician knowledge could positively impact physician recommendation, administration, and referral for adult vaccination in the US.',\n",
       " 'Today, only one type of vaccine is available to protect against tuberculosis. This vaccine, called Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) was developed approximately 100 years ago and has been administered at least 3 billion times. Initial multicenter studies have indicated an up to 93% efficacy against childhood tuberculosis mortality. Subsequently, many studies on BCG efficacy have been carried out, with highly variable results, ranging from 0 to 90% efficacy. The reasons for this heterogeneity are not well understood. Large clinical studies have shown that booster vaccinations with BCG do not improve the BCG efficacy. Therefore, new vaccines are urgently needed. Today, there are essentially two lines of efforts being pursued in several laboratories. One of them aims at replacing BCG with superior vaccines. This strategy focuses either on improving existing BCG by constructing strains that overproduce certain protective antigens and/or by improving its immunogenicity, or on starting anew by genetically attenuating virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The second line of research aims at adding onto BCG vaccination, such as a heterologous prime-boost strategy. For this strategy BCG is used as a first vaccine, followed by individual antigens as a booster. These antigens can be presented in several different ways, and preference is currently given to the so-called latency antigens. Both approaches have yielded encouraging results in animal models, and some of them have now entered clinical trials. Although still far from human applications, it is hoped that these strategies will ultimately help to reduce the enormous burden that is caused by tuberculosis.',\n",
       " \"An increasing number of new and improved vaccines to prevent childhood diseases are being introduced. Combination vaccines represent one solution to the problem of increased numbers of injections during single clinic visits. This statement provides general guidance on the use of combination vaccines and related issues and questions. To minimize the number of injections children receive, parenteral combination vaccines should be used, if licensed and indicated for the patient's age, instead of their equivalent component vaccines. Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines, in either monovalent or combination formulations from the same or different manufacturers, are interchangeable for sequential doses in the vaccination series. However, using acellular pertussis vaccine product(s) from the same manufacturer is preferable for at least the first three doses, until studies demonstrate the interchangeability of these vaccines. Immunization providers should stock sufficient types of combination and monovalent vaccines needed to vaccinate children against all diseases for which vaccines are recommended, but they need not stock all available types or brandname products. When patients have already received the recommended vaccinations for some of the components in a combination vaccine, administering the extra antigen(s) in the combination is often permissible if doing so will reduce the number of injections required. To overcome recording errors and ambiguities in the names of vaccine combinations, improved systems are needed to enhance the convenience and accuracy of transferring vaccine-identifying information into medical records and immunization registries. Further scientific and programmatic research is needed on specific questions related to the use of combination vaccines.\",\n",

       " \"Background: Vaccination hesitancy and skepticism among parents hinders progress in achieving full vaccination coverage. Swedish measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine coverage is high however some areas with low vaccination coverage risk outbreaks. This study aimed to explore factors influencing the decision of Somali parents living in the Rinkeby and Tensta districts of Stockholm, Sweden, on whether or not to vaccinate their children with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Method: Participants were 13 mothers of at least one child aged 18 months to 5 years, who were recruited using snowball sampling. In-depth interviews were conducted in Somali and Swedish languages and the data generated was analysed using qualitative content analysis. Both written and verbal informed consent were obtained from participants. Results: Seven of the mothers had not vaccinated their youngest child at the time of the study and decided to postpone the vaccination until their child became older (delayers). The other six mothers had vaccinated their child for MMR at the appointed time (timely vaccinators). The analysis of the data revealed two main themes: (1) barriers to vaccinate on time, included issues surrounding fear of the child not speaking and unpleasant encounters with nurses and (2) facilitating factors to vaccinate on time, included heeding vaccinating parents' advice, trust in nurses and trust in God. The mothers who had vaccinated their children had a positive impact in influencing other mothers to also vaccinate. Conclusions: Fear, based on the perceived risk that vaccination will lead to autism, among Somali mothers in Tensta and Rinkeby is evident and influenced by the opinions of friends and relatives. Child Healthcare Center nurses are important in the decision-making process regarding acceptance of MMR vaccination. There is a need to address mothers' concerns regarding vaccine safety while improving the approach of nurses as they address these concerns.\",\n",

       " \"OBJECTIVES: To identify parent-reported reasons for non-receipt of adolescent vaccinations by provider recommendation status. METHODS: Parental reasons for non-receipt of adolescent vaccines were analyzed among adolescents 13-17 years using data from the 2009 National Immunization Survey-Teen (n=20,066). RESULTS: Among unvaccinated adolescents, 87.9% (Td/Tdap), 90.9% (MenACWY), and 66.0% (HPV) of parents reported that they did not receive a healthcare provider recommendation for their adolescent to receive the vaccine. Among those without a provider recommendation, the most common reasons for not receiving the vaccines were 'vaccine not recommended' [Td/Tdap, MenACWY] and 'not needed' [HPV]. Among those with a recommendation, the most common parental reasons were 'lack of knowledge' [Td/Tdap], 'vaccine not needed' [MenACWY], and 'lack of knowledge' [HPV]. CONCLUSIONS: Non-receipt of provider recommendations was a main parent-reported reason for not getting vaccinated. Increasing parental knowledge and vaccination coverage through increased provider-parent communication about disease risk and vaccine benefits is needed.\",\n",
       " 'Although influenza and pneumonia are largely vaccine-preventable, vaccination coverage rates are well below Healthy People 2010 goals. The aim of this study was to examine the costs and cost-effectiveness of three provider-based vaccination interventions in the hospital setting: standing orders programs (SOPs), physician reminders (PRs), and pre-printed orders (PPOs). Data on program operating costs and the numbers of patients who received influenza or pneumococcal vaccinations were collected from nine North Carolina hospitals. Results demonstrated that the additional cost per patient vaccinated in 2004 was US dollars 58 for SOPs, US dollars 90 for PRs, and US dollars 412 for PPOs. These findings suggest that SOPs are a cost-effective approach for increasing adult vaccination coverage rates in hospital settings.',\n",
       " \"To examine health providers' perceived barriers, supports, and vaccination actions in delivering the HPV vaccine to females ages 9-17 in four states. Differences in providers' HPV vaccination of pre-adolescents compared with older adolescents were explored. A random sample of 1,500 pediatricians, family physicians, gynecologists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants from four states were asked to complete a mail survey. Providers were recruited through state medical and nursing boards. The final sample included 227 respondents. Among those participants, health providers vaccinated older females (ages 13-17) at significantly higher rates than pre-adolescents (ages 9-12) in all four states. Providers who reported increased barriers to HPV vaccination were significantly less likely to vaccinate girls in either age group. The most frequent barriers reported by providers included the financial burden of the HPV vaccine and encountering patients (more often patients' parents) who have negative perceptions of vaccine. Most common supports included a personal belief in the positive impact of the HPV vaccine, followed by providers feeling comfortable talking with parents about the sexual nature of the vaccine, and the importance of adhering to the CDC's recommendations on HPV vaccination. Age of patient will likely influence providers' HPV vaccination behaviors, particularly if parents have concerns about vaccinating their pre-adolescents. Providers can best serve their patients when they are aware of the potential barriers and supports that may influence their HPV vaccination behaviors.\",\n",

Surveillance of Adverse Events following Vaccination in the Community (SAEFVIC) is an enhanced passive surveillance system that collects, analyses and reports information about AEFI in Victoria, Australia. We describe the incidence, timing and type of potential IHR following vaccination in preschool children reported over an 8-year period. A total of 2110 AEFI were reported in 1620 children, of which 23.5% (496) were classified as potential IHR. Of these, 37.1% (184) were suspected to be IgE-mediated, (including anaphylaxis, angioedema and/or urticaria) and 83.5% (414) occurred within 15\\xa0minutes of vaccination. The incidence of potential IHR was 5.4 per 100,000 doses, with that of suspected IgE-mediated IHR being 2.0 per 100,000 doses. The incidence of anaphylaxis was extremely low (0.13 per 100,000 doses) and is consistent with other published studies. Potential IHR following immunization should be reported to appropriate local pharmacovigilance systems and patients reviewed by specialists able to evaluate, investigate and manage future vaccinations.',\n",

       " 'Key debates on improving vaccination coverage tend to focus on factors that affect uptake in the public health system while ignoring the private sector that plays an important role in providing health services in any low or middle-income country setting. Using in-depth interviews, we explored factors that influenced the decision of parents as well as pediatricians working in the private sector across 8 Indian cities on whether their children should be vaccinated with a particular vaccine Pediatricians and their relationship with parents was an important factor that influenced the decision on whether parents vaccinated their children with a particular vaccine or not. The decision to recommend a vaccine is taken on the principle that it is better to be safe than sorry than on any objective assessment of whether a child requires a particular vaccine or not. Family members and social factors also played a major role in the decision-making. According to some parents, vaccinating their child added an aspirational value to their growth. This is especially true of the newer vaccines that are considered optional in India. The cost of a vaccine did not come up as an inhibiting factor in the decision to vaccinate a child. Access to appropriate evidence was limited for both pediatricians and parents and evidence per se played a minimal role in the final decision to vaccinate a child or not. Far more important were the influences of factors such as relationship with the pediatrician, the role of decisions related to vaccination taken by people in the immediate social network.',\n",
       " \"Both seasonal influenza vaccination and pneumococcal vaccination are recommended for elderly diabetics. The aim of the study was to determine the rate of seasonal influenza vaccination over the previous twelve months, pneumococcal vaccination over a lifetime, and to identify predictors which affect likelihood of vaccination. 219 diabetics elders were detailed questioned 3 months after the end of 2012/2013 influenza season. 26.48% of patients have been vaccinated against influenza in the last year and only 9.13% of patients reported pneumococcal vaccination in the past. The logistic regression analysis revealed that variables which increased the likelihood of having been vaccinated against influenza were: higher number of anti-hyperglycemic medications, increased number of co-morbidities, higher patients' income, recommendation of vaccination from General Practitioners (GPs) and specialist. Significant predictors of pneumococcal vaccine uptake included increased number of co-morbidities and recommendation of vaccination received from GPs and specialist. The commonest reasons given by those unvaccinated were lack of information about immunization and low perceived benefits of vaccination. Of patients who were not treated with influenza vaccine 86.7% had never received recommendation from specialist and 71.4% had never been advised by GPs. Influenza vaccination was too expensive to 24.85% of patients. The vaccination rate among elderly diabetics in Poland is low. Lack of knowledge and patients' income are the main barriers. Increased awareness of healthcare professionals to educate and encourage vaccination and propagation of free vaccinations to all people at risk may increase the rate of vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal disease.\",\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta and Sweden maintain their national provisions for a transitional period regarding rules concerning rabies vaccination and individual serological test for rabies neutralizing antibodies. The purpose of vaccinating dogs against rabies is to establish pre-exposure immunity and protect individual animals from contracting rabies.The aim of the study was to investigate factors associated with reaching the internationally accepted threshold antibody titre of 0.5 IU/mL after rabies vaccination of dogs. METHODS: The study was a prospective single cohort study including 6,789 samples from Swedish dogs vaccinated with commercially available vaccines in Sweden, and the dog's antibody responses were determined by the OIE approved FAVN test. Information on potential risk factors; breed, age, gender, date of vaccination, vaccine label and the number of vaccinations, was collected for each dog. Associations between the dependent variable, serological response ≥ 0.5 IU/mL or < 0.5 IU/mL and each of the potential risk factors were investigated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 6,789 vaccinated dogs, 6,241 (91.9%) had an approved test result of ≥ 0.5 IU/mL. The results of the multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that vaccinating with vaccine B reduced the risk of having antibody titres of < 0.5 IU/mL by 0.2 times compared with vaccination using vaccine A. Breed size was found significant as an interaction with number of vaccinations and age at vaccination as an interaction with day of antibody testing after last vaccination. In summary, larger breeds were at higher risk of having antibody titres of < 0.5 IU/mL but if vaccinated twice this risk was reduced. Moreover, there were a increased risk for dogs < 6 months of age and > 5 years of age to have antibody titres of < 0.5 IU/mL, but this was affected by number of days from vaccination till testing. CONCLUSIONS: The probability of success of rabies vaccinations of dogs depends on type of vaccine used, number of rabies vaccinations, the breed size of the dog, age at vaccination, and number of days after vaccination when the antibody titres are tested. The need for a booster vaccination regimen is recommended for larger breeds of dog.\",\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Vaccination status is often categorized as complete or not-complete. This ignores the potentially important heterogeneity in children whose vaccinations are not-complete. We sought to subcategorize not-completely vaccinated children and determine whether characteristics differed among these subgroups. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study assessed vaccination status at 2 years of age for 43,965 children in the 2008 Alberta (Canada) birth cohort who were registered with provincial vital statistics records. Children were categorized (based on the five routinely scheduled childhood vaccines) as complete, incomplete, selective, or non-vaccination status. Characteristics derived from administrative health databases were used to determine factors associated with vaccination status. RESULTS: Population-level vaccination status at 2 years of age was found to be: 71.1% complete and 28.9% not complete (21.9% incomplete, 2.0% selective, and 5.1% non-vaccinated). Midwife delivery at home, compared to physician delivery in hospital, was strongly associated with non-vaccination status (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 51.70, 95% CI 37.10-72.10). Factors that might pose barriers to vaccination, such as single marital status (aOR 1.58, 95% CI 1.49-1.67), large number of household children (≥4 vs. 1) (aOR 3.24, 95% CI 2.95-3.54), and multiple household moves (≥3 vs. 0) (aOR 1.69, 95% CI 1.35-2.10), were all strongly associated with incomplete vaccination status. CONCLUSIONS: Of the children who were not completely vaccinated at age 2, the vast majority had started but not completed the vaccination series, while a smaller number were selectively vaccinated or not vaccinated at all. Distinct differences are present among these groups that require attention when addressing vaccine coverage.',\n",

       " 'Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious public-health issue in China. While the hepatitis B vaccine is effective in preventing HBV infection, the HBV vaccination coverage rates among Chinese adults remain low. From a survey of rural adults from 7 provinces in China, we identified a unique HBV at-risk group: rural adults who had no history of HBV vaccination and had no plan to HBV vaccinate in the future. We divided this \\'no history-no plan\\' group into those who identified No-need to vaccinate and those that perceived a Need to vaccinate (even if they had no plan to do so). We found age, marital status, health status, perceived HBV infection environment, perceived HBV infection risk and perceived HBV infection severity explained differences between the \\'No-need\\' and \\'Need\" to HBV vaccinate groups. Education, occupation and knowledge of hepatitis B and HBV transmission were not associated with HBV vaccination need. Our results showed that free HBV vaccinations and reimbursement for vaccinating could significantly increase the HBV vaccinate take-up rate for both Need and No-need rural adults. A tailored public health HBV campaign, especially targeting the No-need subgroup, would increase vaccination rates by better informing rural adults about HBV transmission routes, the dangers of HBV infection, the effectiveness of HBV vaccinations and the safety of HBV vaccinations.',\n",

       " 'PURPOSE: Two hundreds years after the discovery of the smallpox vaccine, immunization remains one of the most powerful tools of preventive medicine. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: Immunization was born with Jenner, then Pasteur and expanded during the 19th and 20th century. It started with the empirical observation of cross-immunity between two diseases, cowpox and smallpox. It became a real science, with pathogen isolation, culture and attenuation or inactivation, to prepare a vaccine. Together with clinical and biological efficacy studies and adverse events assessments, it constructed the concept of \"vaccinology\". Protein conjugation of polyosidic vaccines has made possible early immunisation of infants. Nowadays, recombinant, reassortant, or virus-like particles technologies open the road for new vaccines. FUTURE PROSPECTS: Ongoing research opens the way for the development of new vaccines that will help to control transmittable diseases for which we are lacking antimicrobial agents.',\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVE: To determine the reasons adolescents are not vaccinated for specific vaccines and how these reasons have changed over time. METHODS: We analyzed the 2008-2010 National Immunization Survey of Teens examining reasons parents do not have their teens immunized. Parents whose teens were not up to date (Not-UTD) for Tdap/Td and MCV4 were asked the main reason they were not vaccinated. Parents of female teens Not-UTD for human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) were asked their intent to give HPV, and those unlikely to get HPV were asked the main reason why not. RESULTS: The most frequent reasons for not vaccinating were the same for Tdap/Td and MCV4, including \"Not recommended\" and \"Not needed or not necessary.\" For HPV, the most frequent reasons included those for the other vaccines as well as 4 others, including \"Not sexually active\" and \"Safety concerns/Side effects.\" \"Safety concerns/Side effects\" increased from 4.5% in 2008 to 7.7% in 2009 to 16.4% in 2010 and, in 2010, approaching the most common reason \"Not Needed or Not Necessary\" at 17.4% (95% CI: 15.7-19.1). Although parents report that health care professionals increasingly recommend all vaccines, including HPV, the intent to not vaccinate for HPV increased from 39.8% in 2008 to 43.9% in 2010 (OR for trend 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04-1.13). CONCLUSIONS: Despite doctors increasingly recommending adolescent vaccines, parents increasingly intend not to vaccinate female teens with HPV. The concern about safety of HPV grew with each year. Addressing specific and growing parental concerns about HPV will require different considerations than those for the other vaccines.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Since 1977, vaccinations to protect against tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, and measles (and rubella since 2009) have been offered to children in Haiti through the routine immunization program. From April to July 2009, a national vaccination coverage survey was conducted to assess the success of the routine immunization program at reaching children in Haiti. METHODS: A multi-stage cluster survey was conducted using a modified WHO method for household sampling. A standardized questionnaire was administered to collect vaccination histories, demographic information, and reasons for under-vaccination of children aged 12-23 months. A child who received the eight recommended routine vaccinations was considered fully vaccinated. The routine vaccination schedule was used to define valid doses and estimate the percentage of children vaccinated on time. RESULTS: Among 1345 children surveyed, 40.4% (95% CI: 36.6-44.2) of the 840 children with vaccination cards had received all eight recommended vaccinations. Coverage was highest for the Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine (87.3%), the first doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (92.0%), and oral poliovirus vaccine (93.4%) and lowest for measles vaccine (46.9%). Timely vaccination rates were lower. Assuming similar coverage for the 505 children without cards, coverage with the complete vaccination series among all surveyed children 31.9%. Reasons for under-vaccination included not having enough time to reach the vaccination location (24.8%), having a child who was ill (13.8%), and not knowing when, or forgetting, to go for vaccination (12.8%). CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Coverage for early-infant vaccines was high; however, most children did not complete the full vaccination series, and many children received vaccinations later than recommended. Efforts to improve the immunization program should include increasing the frequency of outreach services, training for vaccination staff to minimize missed opportunities, and better communicating the timing of vaccinations to encourage caregivers to bring their children for vaccinations at the recommended age. Efforts to promote the benefits of vaccination and card retention are also needed.',\n",

       " 'The AAHA has undertaken the development of this document in an effort to inform veterinary practitioners, clarify misunderstandings held by veterinarians, and encourage practitioners to recognize that immunization of patients is a medical procedure. As such, it is bound by the same tenets that govern the recommendation of other medical procedures-principally, that it be tailored to the needs of the individual patient. Many diseases we immunize against are ubiquitous. Many are serious and some even life threatening. Some are of limited demographic concern given the exposure risk for each patient. These factors have all been considered in developing the AAHA Canine Vaccination Guidelines. In the end, each veterinarian must do what he or she determines to be in the best interest of the patient. Vaccination of individual animals produces not only individual immunity but also population or herd immunity. Since we have no readily available and reliable way to determine if each patient has developed an adequate immune response, we encourage the practice philosophy of vaccinating more patients while vaccinating each patient no more than needed.',\n",
       " 'A growing number of people use the Internet to obtain health information, including information about vaccines. Websites that allow and promote interaction among users are an increasingly popular source of health information. Users of such so-called Web 2.0 applications (e.g. social media), while still in the minority, represent a growing proportion of online communicators, including vocal and active anti-vaccination groups as well as public health communicators. In this paper, the authors: define Web 2.0 and examine how it may influence vaccination decisions; discuss how anti-vaccination movements use Web 2.0 as well as the challenges Web 2.0 holds for public health communicators; describe the types of information used in these different settings; introduce the theoretical background that can be used to design effective vaccination communication in a Web 2.0 environment; make recommendations for practice and pose open questions for future research. The authors conclude that, as a result of the Internet and Web 2.0, private and public concerns surrounding vaccinations have the potential to virally spread across the globe in a quick, efficient and vivid manner. Web 2.0 may influence vaccination decisions by delivering information that alters the perceived personal risk of vaccine-preventable diseases or vaccination side-effects. It appears useful for public health officials to put effort into increasing the effectiveness of existing communication by implementing interactive, customized communication. A key step to providing successful public health communication is to identify those who are particularly vulnerable to finding and using unreliable and misleading information. Thus, it appears worthwhile that public health websites strive to be easy to find, easy to use, attractive in its presentation and readily provide the information, support and advice that the searcher is looking for. This holds especially when less knowledgeable individuals are in need of reliable information about vaccination risks and benefits.',\n",

This paper uses data from the 2013/14 New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) survey (N=16,642) to explore the distribution, and demographic and personality correlates of New Zealanders\\' attitudes towards the safety of childhood vaccinations. Around two thirds (68.5%) of New Zealanders strongly agreed/were confident that \"it is safe to vaccinate children following the standard New Zealand immunisation schedule,\" 26% were skeptical and 5.5% were strongly opposed. Multiple regression analysis indicated that people lower on Conscientiousness and Agreeableness but higher on Openness to Experience expressed lower confidence about vaccine safety. Having higher subjective health satisfaction, living rurally, being Māori, single, employed and not a parent were all associated with lower confidence, while a higher income and educational attainment were associated with greater confidence. Our findings suggest that the majority of New Zealand adults trust in the safety of scheduled childhood vaccinations, but about one third do express some degree of concern. This finding highlights the importance of improving public education about the safety and necessity of vaccinations.',\n",

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTINGS: This is a cross-sectional study among pediatric physicians and nurses working at primary clinics (curative service) and mother-child health clinics (preventive service) in Jewish localities in the Northern District of Israel. METHODS: A structured, anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was used. RESULTS: The study included 271 HCPs (response rate\\u202f=\\u202f72.2%). An insufficient knowledge level about vaccines was demonstrated among participants (mean score: 5.2\\u202f±\\u202f0.91 and 4.71\\u202f±\\u202f1.21 points out of 6 in the preventive and curative services, respectively; p\\u202f=\\u202f0.000).

The two predictors that were associated with the behavior of HCPs to encourage childhood vaccinations were workplace (preventive vs. curative service) and the number of parents encountered by the HCP who opposed or feared vaccines. No association was found between the behavior and the knowledge level and the attitudes. Of the HCPs, 79.3% were interested in immunization training and 66.1% in participating in workshops to improve their communication skills to cope with vaccine-hesitant parents. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to increase the commitment of HCPs to encourage parents to vaccinate their children with routine vaccines, to improve their knowledge about vaccines, and to provide them with communication tools to deal with vaccine-hesitant parents.\",\n",

The current KiGGS data can be used to assess the current vaccination status of 3‑ to 17-year-olds and trends in the 1985-2013 birth cohorts.Of the 15,023 total participants in KiGGS Wave\\xa02, 3238 aged 3-17\\xa0years participated in the KiGGS Wave\\xa02 examinations and submitted the complete vaccination certificate or were, according to their parents, unvaccinated. In this group, vaccination coverage was high for the majority of vaccinations for both girls and boys. Vaccination coverage has increased in children and adolescents in the last 10\\xa0years. This is especially true for vaccines for which there were strong deficiencies in the KiGGS baseline study, such as the hepatitis\\xa0B and second measles vaccinations in all age groups, the booster dose against pertussis (11- to 17-year olds), as well as the booster dose against tetanus in the 7‑ to 10-year-olds.Sociodemographic factors are still determinants of vaccination status. Less than one child in two is vaccinated against hepatitis\\xa0B (45.9%) when parents state fear of side effects or indicate vaccine skepticism as reasons against vaccinations. Despite significant increases, vaccination coverage at the end of the second year of life is still far below 95% for all vaccinations (measles: 1st\\xa0dose: 88.6%; 2nd\\xa0dose: 64.4%) even in the most recent birth cohorts.The results show where further efforts are needed to increase vaccination coverage by the remaining last percentage points, achieve the timely delivery of all vaccinations listed in the immunization schedule, as well as meet the defined elimination goals.',\n",
       " 'To determine how frequently emergency department (ED) patients are vaccinated against influenza and pneumococcus, we analyzed all adult ED vaccinations in the combined databases of the annual National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys, 1992-2000. During this period, EDs gave 27,738,000 vaccinations (95%CI: 25,878,000-29,598,000). Of these, 93% (87-100%) were against tetanus. The count of pneumococcal or influenza vaccinations was too small to permit estimation of a national total. Large-scale vaccination of ED patients appears feasible, given the tetanus experience, but ED patients are rarely vaccinated against influenza or pneumococcus. Reasons for this disconnect between burden of disease and preventive practices are discussed.',\n",
       " 'Control strategies of infectious diseases at a regional level can rely on vaccination. When the decision to vaccinate is made by each farmer on a voluntary basis, a farmer vaccinates to protect his own herd. If the vaccinated herds are protected against infection, the risk for other herds is reduced, creating a positive externality (i.e. an impact on a third party not directly involved in the decision). The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effectiveness at a regional level of voluntary vaccination and to analyse the effect of financial incentives and compensation for losses due to disease considering the externalities due to vaccination. We developed a dynamic deterministic model, based on a decision model interacting with an epidemiological state transition model. It determines the proportion of farmers who vaccinate over time, and the evolution of the prevalence of infected herds in a population of herds exposed to the same risk. The behaviour of farmers is modelled assuming perfect information (farmers are fully informed about prevalence, costs of disease and costs of vaccination). The decision to vaccinate is made according to a rational economic behaviour: farmers make their choices to maximize their expected utility, considering their risk aversion. The expected utility is calculated with a decision tree. The epidemiological model is based on a SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) model modified to consider imperfect vaccination that protects herds for one year. The model is studied analytically and by simulation. For simulations, we define the epidemiological parameters of the model (transmission rate and average duration of the infectious and recovered states), the herd level effectiveness of the vaccination, the cost of vaccination, the reduction of income due to the disease, the incomes of the farmers and the risk aversion of the farmers. These parameters are based on an endemic disease, BVD (Bovine Viral Diarrhoea). The model shows that voluntary vaccination cannot eradicate the modelled disease. Risk aversion of farmers leads to a lower prevalence at the equilibrium than when farmers are risk neutral. Incentives for vaccination decrease the prevalence but do not result in eradication of the disease. Compensating for disease losses in newly infected farms leads to an increase in prevalence, due to moral hazard (farmers behave less carefully than if they were fully exposed to the risk), except if it is restricted to vaccinated herds.',\n",

       " \"INTRODUCTION: Vaccination of health care workers (HCW) reduces transmission of influenza among patients, yet uptake of vaccination remains low. If vaccination education is integrated into the early medical school curriculum, will student attitudes toward the vaccine change? The objectives of the study were to: (1) Determine influenza vaccination rates among entering medical students; (2) Assess the attitudes toward influenza vaccination; (3) Evaluate the effects of a multifaceted educational intervention on attitudes to vaccination. METHODS: Entering medical students were surveyed before and after an intervention at the beginning of the influenza season. This intervention provided by an inter-professional team, included education about influenza, importance of vaccination for HCWs, followed by vaccination administration practice, and ended with students vaccinating consenting classmates. RESULTS: The pre-intervention surveys and intervention were completed by 124 of 125 (99%) students. Pre-intervention survey revealed 60 (48%) of students had been previously vaccinated. Of the vaccinated students 91% had been recommended vaccination by their healthcare provider compared to 43% of non-vaccinated students. More positive attitudes were noted in the vaccinated students compared to non-vaccinated students: importance of vaccination (p<0.01); HCWs should be vaccinated (p<0.01); recommendation of vaccine to family and friends (p<0.01). 97 (78%) students completed post-intervention surveys. Significant improvement in these attitudes was noted post-intervention compared to pre-intervention: importance of vaccination 93% versus 71% (p<0.01); HCWs should be vaccinated 95% versus 83% (p<0.01); recommendation to family and friends 93% versus 73% (p<0.01); comfort with vaccine counseling 92% versus 41%; comfort with vaccine administration 84% versus 22% (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Educating medical students and promoting the importance of vaccination early in a medical student's career using such an intervention is relatively simple and easily integrated into the curriculum. This intervention was successful in vaccinating all students, and demonstrated a marked positive shift in attitudes toward influenza vaccination.\",\n",
       " 'Organizations in developed countries with limited financial resources may find it difficult to determine whether it is preferable to use these resources for HPV vaccination, management of HPV-related diseases, or a \"hybrid\" strategy, such as vaccinating only the highest risk individuals. We determined the organizational costs and clinical impacts of three different organizational approaches to female HPV vaccination in a low-resource setting, including vaccinating everyone, vaccinating no one, or vaccinating only those considered high-risk. To determine patients at highest risk, HPV risk factors were identified using information routinely gathered at the annual preventive maintenance visit. The three vaccination strategies were then compared using a decision tree analysis. The three strategies demonstrated very little difference in cost. However, the least expensive strategy was to vaccinate no one. In contrast, the strategy with the best clinical outcomes was for the organization to vaccinate everyone. Organizations with limited resources must decide how to best allocate these funds to provide the greatest clinical benefits. This study showed little difference in costs but improved clinical outcomes when using the universal HPV vaccination strategy. Thus, the improvement in clinical outcomes when vaccinating everyone may be worth the relatively small increase in cost of vaccinating everyone.',\n",

       " 'Healthcare providers can play a key role in reaching the target for vaccine uptake through educating the public on the risk may be of severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines. Thus, it is important to resolve reports in the literature which present conflicting data on vaccine safety. We performed a prospective study of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinations administered at the Albany Community Vaccination Center. All potential vaccinees to the site were screened for allergic history prior to triage by a board-certified allergist. In the first 14\\xa0days of operation, our site vaccinated 14,655 individuals, 3.9% of which had a personal history of anaphylaxis. While some vaccine recipients had non-allergic complications, none of the visitors suffered any objective, immediate allergic symptoms. Our findings indicate that specialist-confirmed rates of immediate allergic reaction to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are far lower than self-reported rates defined by subjective, unconfirmed symptoms.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: On the day of a workshop (named \"Vaccino Day\") on vaccinations, organized for the students of the University of Palermo by the ERSU (Regional Office for the Right to University Study), the sample of students were given a questionnaire to fill out. The aim of the survey was to investigate the perception of vaccinations on a sample population made up of university students. STUDY DESIGN: A self-administered paper questionnaire was given to participants of the workshop. The questionnaire is divided into 3 parts: demographic, economic and habits informations have been asked in the first part; in the second part, they had to answer the question: \"What term do you associate with vaccination?\"; in the third part, they were posed the question: \"Have you ever had any adverse reactions after being vaccinated?\". Therefore, the percentage response frequencies and the statistically significant Odds-Ratio (aOR) are presented with a corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical analysis was performed using the STATA® 14 software. METHODS: A total of 350 students were asked to participate and the response rate was 100%, the 61.43% of the interviewed population was made up of females. Taking into account the dependent variable: \"at least a moderate-severe adverse reaction after a vaccination\" the statistically significant independent variables associated are \"Have fear of side effects\" (aOR 7.06, 95% CI 1.73-28.57, p=0.006), \"I associate the term \"vaccination\" to Needles/syringes\" (aOR 3.82, 95% CI 1.08-13.48, p=0.037), \"I associate the term \"vaccination\" to Protection\" (aOR 3.50, 95% CI 1.02-11.98, p=0.046). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination is still influenced by emotional factors and lack of campaigns providing adequate information, therefore negative judgement tend to outweigh the real risks and benefits. Considering that the sample was composed of university students, being highly educated and capable of becoming opinion leaders in the future, there is a need to create a more efficient communication protocol that make the student, and then the citizen, better aware of the actual risks associated with vaccinations and their real benefits.',\n",

Nevertheless, some obstacles e.g. the production of a safe Hepatitis B vaccine, could not be taken by classical techniques.

       " 'Misinformation and movements against vaccines put public health at risk. This study investigated vaccine awareness and opinions on the anti-vaccination movement among students at three faculties of Eastern Mediterranean University. Data were collected by questionnaire. Exposure to anti-vaccination propaganda increased proportionally with the size of the cities where participants were born. In total, 88.6% of the participants declared that they planned to vaccinate their children, while those who did not cited various reasons including the belief that vaccines do not work, that vaccines are harmful, and that it is better to be infected naturally. 60.6% of participants reported that they would get vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 if there was an effective vaccine. Meanwhile, 24.5% of participants were not sure whether would get vaccinated even if it were possible, 11.4% of participants stated that they would not vaccinate their children for a variety of reasons. These results are important, especially in the context of a pandemic, because students will become leaders in education, business, and media, and thus shape the thoughts and opinions of future generations. The anti-vaccination movement is building momentum, and is especially influential in big cities; therefore, it is vital to change our approach to informing students about vaccination.',\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: Current therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients often involves agents that suppress the immune system, placing patients at an increased risk for developing infections, of which several are potentially vaccine preventable. Many IBD patients are not being vaccinated appropriately. The aims of this study were to assess gastroenterologist's knowledge regarding vaccinating the IBD patient, eliciting the barriers that prevent vaccinations, and defining the gastroenterologist's role in vaccinations. METHODS: One thousand gastroenterologists, randomly selected from the membership of the American College of Gastroenterology, were asked to complete a 19 question electronic survey regarding the suitable vaccines for the immunocompetent and immunosuppressed IBD patient and the barriers to recommending the vaccines. The perceived role of the gastroenterologist versus the primary care physician (PCP) was also assessed. RESULTS: In all, 108 responses were analyzed; 68 (62%) gastroenterologists managed 40+ IBD patients, with 65 (52%) asking their patients about immunization history most or all of the time. The majority believed that the PCP should determine which vaccinations to give (64%) and to administer the vaccines (83%). Overall, 66%-88% of gastroenterologists correctly recommended the inactivated vaccines for their IBD patients not on immunosuppressive therapies while 20%-30% incorrectly recommended administering the live vaccines to their immunosuppressed patients. CONCLUSIONS: Gastroenterologist knowledge of the appropriate immunizations to recommend to the IBD patient is poor and may be the primary reason why the majority of gastroenterologists believe that the PCP should be responsible for vaccinations. Educational programs on vaccinations directed to gastroenterologists who prescribe immunosuppressive agents are needed.\",\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: Vaccines are specific medicines characterized by two country-specific market access processes: (1) a recommendation by National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG), and (2) a funding policy decision. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare and analyze NITAGs of 13 developed countries by describing vaccination committees' bodies and working processes. METHODS: Information about NITAGs bodies and working processes was searched from official sources from June 2011 to November 2012. Retrieved information was completed from relevant articles identified through a systematic literature review and by information provided by direct contact with NITAGs or parent organizations. An expert panel was also conducted to discuss, validate, and provide additional input on obtained results. RESULTS: While complete information, defined as 100%, was retrieved only for the UK, at least 80% of data was retrieved for 9 countries out of the 13 selected countries. Terms of references were identified in 7 countries, and the main mission for all NITAGs was to provide advice for National immunization programs. However, these terms of references did not fully encompass all the actual missions of the NITAGs. Decision analysis frameworks were identified for 10 out of the 13, and all NITAGs considered at least four criteria for decision-making: disease burden, efficacy/effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness. Advices were published by most NITAGs, but few NITAGs published meeting agendas and minutes. Only the United States had open meetings. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports previous findings about the disparities in NITAGs processes which could potentially explain the disparity in access to vaccinations and immunization programs across Europe. With NITAGs recommendations being used by policy decision makers for implementation and funding of vaccine programs, guidances should be well-informed and transparent to ensure National Immunization Programs' (NIP) credibility among the public and health care professionals.\",\n",

       " 'We examined the coverage and timing of rotavirus vaccination and the impact of rotavirus vaccine introduction on coverage and timing of the pentavalent vaccine. We used data from the Demographic and Health Surveys in Honduras (2011/2012) and Peru (2012). The samples were divided into 2 subcohorts: children born before and after the introduction of rotavirus vaccine. We compared coverage and timing of the pentavalent vaccine in the aforementioned subcohorts. Coverage with the first and second doses of rotavirus vaccination was 95% (95% confidence intervals: 93-97%) and 91% (89-95%) in Honduras and 79% (77-82%) and 72% (69-75%) in Peru, respectively. Coverage increased in both countries over the years. The proportion of children vaccinated according to age-appropriate vaccination schedules varied between 67% (second dose of rotavirus vaccinations in Peru) and 89% (first dose of rotavirus vaccination in Honduras). Coverage with the first and second doses of pentavalent vaccination remained constant over the years in Honduras, while in Peru there was a significant increase in coverage over the years (p for trend, <0.0001). In both countries, timing of pentavalent vaccination was better in post-rota-cohorts than in pre-rota-cohorts. Since its introduction, coverage of rotavirus vaccination has improved over time in both countries. An introduction of rotavirus vaccination in both countries appears to have improved the coverage and timing of other similarly scheduled vaccinations.',\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVE: To describe the results of vaccinating children with a history of serious adverse reactions after vaccination or of egg allergy at a special clinic established for that purpose. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. PATIENTS: Children who attended the clinic between 1 August 1994 and 31 July 1996 after being referred by vaccine providers. SETTING: A clinic conducted in the Emergency Department of The Canberra Hospital, Australian Capital Territory. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reasons for referral; vaccinations given; and subsequent adverse vaccination events. RESULTS: 91 children received 155 vaccinations at the clinic, and only one serious event--a hypotonic/hyporesponsive episode (HHE) after diphtheria-tetanus-whole-cell pertussis (DTPw), oral polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccination--was subsequently reported; this child recovered spontaneously. Fifty-three children referred because of a previous serious adverse vaccination event were revaccinated at the clinic with whole-cell pertussis vaccine (47), combined diphtheria and tetanus vaccine (4), tetanus toxoid (1), and typhoid vaccine (1). Three children (referred because of previous meningitis, subdural haemorrhage or parental suspicion of allergy to DTPw) received their first dose of pertussis vaccine at the clinic. The remaining 35 children had a history of egg allergy and were given measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully vaccinated children with histories of serious reactions to vaccination, including HHEs, convulsions, apnoea, high temperatures and persistent screaming, as well as those with egg allergy. We believe special clinics can improve vaccination coverage.',\n",
       " 'PURPOSE: Approximately 50,000 adults die annually from vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States. Most traditional vaccine providers (eg, physician offices) administer vaccinations during standard clinic hours, but community pharmacies offer expanded hours that allow patients to be vaccinated at convenient times. We analyzed the types of vaccines administered and patient populations vaccinated during off-clinic hours in a national community pharmacy, and their implications for vaccination access and convenience. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data for all vaccinations given at the Walgreens pharmacy chain between August 2011 and July 2012. The time of vaccination was categorized as occurring during traditional hours (9:00 am-6:00 pm weekdays) or off-clinic hours, consisting of weekday evenings, weekends, and federal holidays. We compared demographic characteristics and types of vaccine. We used a logistic regression model to identify predictors of being vaccinated during off-clinic hours. RESULTS: During the study period, pharmacists administered 6,250,402 vaccinations, of which 30.5% were provided during off-clinic hours: 17.4% were provided on weekends, 10.2% on evenings, and 2.9% on holidays. Patients had significantly higher odds of off-clinic vaccination if they were younger than 65 years of age, were male, resided in an urban area, and did not have any chronic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of adults being vaccinated receive their vaccines during evening, weekend, and holiday hours at the pharmacy, when traditional vaccine providers are likely unavailable. Younger, working-aged, healthy adults, in particular, a variety of immunizations during off-clinic hours. With the low rates of adult and adolescent vaccination in the United States, community pharmacies are creating new opportunities for vaccination that expand access and convenience.',\n",

       " \"BACKGROUND: The Standards for Adult Immunization Practice (Standards), revised in 2014, emphasize that adult-care providers assess vaccination status of adult patients at every visit, recommend vaccination, administer needed vaccines or refer to a vaccinating provider, and document vaccinations administered in state/local immunization information systems (IIS). Providers report numerous systems- and provider-level barriers to vaccinating adults, such as billing, payment issues, lower prioritization of vaccines due to competing demands, and lack of information about the use and utility of IIS. Barriers to vaccination result in missed opportunities to vaccinate adults and contribute to low vaccination coverage. Clinicians' (physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners) and pharmacists' reported barriers to assessment, recommendation, administration, referral, and documentation, provider vaccination practices, and perceptions regarding their adult patients' attitudes toward vaccines were evaluated. METHODS: Data from non-probability-based Internet panel surveys of U.S. clinicians (n\\u202f=\\u202f1714) and pharmacists (n\\u202f=\\u202f261) conducted in February-March 2017 were analyzed using SUDAAN. Weighted proportion of reported barriers to assessment, recommendation, administration, referral, and documentation in IIS were calculated. RESULTS: High percentages (70.0%-97.4%) of clinicians and pharmacists reported they routinely assessed, recommended, administered, and/or referred adults for vaccination. Among those who administered vaccines, 31.6% clinicians' and 38.4% pharmacists' submitted records to IIS. Reported barriers included: (a) assessment barriers: vaccination of adults is not within their scope of practice, inadequate reimbursement for vaccinations; (b) administration barriers: lack of staff to manage/administer vaccines, absence of necessary vaccine storage and handling equipment and provisions; and (c) documentation barriers: unaware if state/city has IIS that includes adults or not sure how their electronic system would link to IIS. CONCLUSION: Although many clinicians and pharmacists reported implementing most of the individual components of the Standards, with the exception of IIS use, there are discrepancies in providers' reported actual practices and their beliefs/perceptions, and barriers to vaccinating adults remain.\",\n",
       " \"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the vaccination status of pregnant women during pregnancy and factors affecting their vaccination. BACKGROUND: Immunisation provided through vaccination is one of the most effective ways to reduce or prevent the risks of disease, disability and death. Maternal and newborn health may be protected and morbidity may be decreased through vaccinating pregnant women when necessary. DESIGN: This was a descriptive and cross-sectional survey. METHODS: This study was conducted in a university hospital in Ankara, Turkey, between 01 March and 31 May 2010. The study was carried out with 198 healthy pregnant women who had completed the 26th week of gestation. Data were collected using the data collection form composed of questions enquiring about the demographic and obstetric features of pregnant women and whether or not they knew that vaccinations could be given during pregnancy, and which vaccines could be used during pregnancy, which vaccine/vaccines they had previously received and the reasons for having been vaccinated or not. RESULTS: Approximately half of the participants had received at least one of the vaccines that may be used in pregnancy (52·0%). The pregnant women received vaccinations for tetanus (47·0%), H1N1 (9·1%), seasonal influenza (3·0%) and hepatitis B (0·5%), respectively. The pregnant women who had been educated about vaccinations had been vaccinated at a statistically significantly higher rate compared with those who had not. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that pregnant women's knowledge about the required vaccines during pregnancy affected their behaviour towards vaccination. Acquiring knowledge about vaccines that may be used during pregnancy from health personnel is effective to increase vaccination. This result may be interpreted as 'acquired information affects behaviour towards vaccination'. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Providing information about immunisation to pregnant women at the antenatal clinic is important in terms of maternal and newborn health. Nurses and midwives working in the antenatal field should be sufficiently educated about immunisation.\",\n",
       " 'While assessing immunization programmes, not only vaccination coverage is important, but also timely receipt of vaccines. We estimated both vaccination coverage and timeliness, as well as reasons for non-vaccination, and identified predictors of delayed or missed vaccination, for vaccines of the first two years of age, in El Salvador. We conducted a cluster survey among children aged 23-59 months. Caregivers were interviewed about the child immunization status and their attitudes towards immunization. Vaccination dates were obtained from children immunization cards at home or at health facilities. We referred to the 2006 vaccination schedule for children below two years: one dose of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) at birth; rotavirus at two and four months; three doses of pentavalent - DTP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis), hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) - and of oral poliomyelitis vaccine (polio) at two, four, and six months; first MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) at 12 months; and first boosters of DTP and OPV at 18 months. Timeliness was assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis; Cox and logistic regression were used to identify predictors of vaccination. We surveyed 2550 children. Coverage was highest for BCG (991%; 95% CI: 98.8-99.5) and lowest for rotavirus, especially second dose (86.3%; 95% CI: 84.2-88.4). The first doses of MMR and DTP had 991% (95% CI: 98.5-99.6) and 977% (95% CI: 970-985), respectively. Overall coverage was 837% (95% CI: 81.4-86.0); 96.4% (95% CI: 95.4-97.5), excluding rotavirus. However, only 26.7% (95% CI: 24.7-28.8) were vaccinated within the age interval recommended by the Expanded Programme on Immunization. Being employed and using the bus for transport to the health facility were associated with age-inappropriate vaccinations; while living in households with only two residents and in the \"Paracentral\", \"Occidental\", and \"Oriental\" regions was associated with age-appropriate vaccinations. Vaccination coverage was high in El Salvador, but general timeliness and rotavirus uptake could be improved.',\n",
       " \"Vaccinations are one of the most effective preventive procedures in modern medicine. However, earlier studies have indicated that homoeopathic physicians do not recommend or apply vaccinations as frequently as their allopathic colleagues. Few studies have been undertaken to clarify this question and most of these have not distinguished between medically and non-medically qualified homoeopathic practitioners. Therefore, misunderstandings have arisen concerning this question. In the study presented only medically qualified colleagues were included. In the course of this study, 219 medically qualified homoeopathic and 281 non-homoeopathic physicians in Germany (response rate 30.4%) returned a questionnaire about the application and recommendation of 17 different vaccinations in their practices. The answers show that the responding homoeopathic physicians do not generally refuse vaccines but rather view them with a specific hierarchy. The 'classical' vaccines against tetanus, diphtheria and poliomyelitis are applied to nearly the same degree as by non-homoeopathic colleagues. Vaccines against childhood diseases, risk group vaccinations and vaccinations judged as ineffective are applied and accepted with more restraint by homoeopathic physicians.\",\n",
       " 'The immunogenicity and safety of an attenuated Bordetella bronchiseptica vaccine for swine atrophic rhinitis (AR) was evaluated in 22 hysterectomy-produced, colostrum-deprived pigs and 18 conventional pigs. None of 8 pigs inoculated at 7 days of age intranasally with greater than or equal to 3 X 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU) of vaccinal strain/pig and 2 of 5 pigs inoculated at 7 days of age intranasally with 3 X 10(4) CFU of the vaccinal strain/pig developed AR after intranasal challenge exposure with a virulent strain at postinoculation week (PIW) 3. The remaining 3 vaccinated pigs and 4 nonvaccinated pigs developed AR. Thirteen pigs were inoculated intranasally with 3 X 10(6) to 3 X 10(9) CFU of the vaccinal strain at 7 days of age. At PIW 12, the pigs were killed and necropsied. None of the pigs had clinical signs of AR and/or pneumonia. Virulence was studied by transmission of vaccinal strain through 3 serial growing passages on the nasal mucosa of a litter of hysterectomy-produced colostrum-deprived pigs. Inoculum (nasal swab samples from 2 pigs 4 days after inoculation with 10(8) CFU of vaccinal strain at 5 days of age) was inoculated into the nasal cavity of 2 nonvaccinated pigs. This procedure was repeated 3 times. After the 1st passage, the vaccinal strain was recovered on postinoculation day 4, but after postinoculation day 4, the vaccinal strain was not recovered until the end of the 3rd passage. Turbinate atrophy or pneumonia was not recognized in these inoculated pigs. The vaccinal strain provided immunogenicity without ill effects.',\n",
       " 'Prevention and control of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) are fundamental activities of successful immunisation programs. AEFI reporting, investigation and analysis, integrated by consultancy for subjects needing a specialized evaluation, represent an ideal model for vaccine safety surveillance. In the Veneto Region of Italy the Green Channel Centre has been created by the local Public Health authority, to offer a consultancy activity for vaccinations at risk of adverse events and to ensure an efficient AEFI surveillance system with regular feedback data for vaccine personnel. This report updates the overall activity provided by the Green Channel between 1992 and 2008, concerning consultations for previous AEFI and contraindications to vaccinations and analysis of AEFI reports. After 1280 consultancy cases, 998 (78%) subjects were found eligible for vaccination, with personalized precautions suggested in 42% of cases. Of a total of 724 patients actually vaccinated as per the Green Channel instructions, only 55 subjects (7.6%) reported mild symptoms and one (0.3%) a moderate allergic reaction. Since 1993, a total of 5,006 AEFI reports have been collected and evaluated by the Green Channel against more than 20 millions of vaccine doses administered with an estimate mean AEFI rate of 2.3 x 10.000 doses per year. The majority of them (94%) were found in causal relationship with vaccines; of these, 267 reports (5,6% - 0.1/10,000 doses) were serious and 9 of these subjects, affected by a neurological event, were not recovered or were still on therapy at follow up. This regional activity has proven efficacious in evaluating and managing individual cases at potential risk of AEFI and integrating the national passive surveillance system.',\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess respondents\\' self-reported choices for vaccinating their young children; knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs (KABs) about vaccination; and communication with their child\\'s vaccination provider. METHODS: A national telephone survey of 1500 parents of children aged 6 to 23 months was conducted in 2010. We calculated proportions of parents who had chosen-or planned-to refuse or delay 1 or more recommended vaccines, and proportions for responses to KABs and communication questions, stratified by vaccination choice (ie, refuse or delay). RESULTS: The response rate was 46%. Among the 96.6% of respondents (95% confidence interval [CI], 95.5%-97.4%; weighted n = 1453) who had chosen for their child to receive at least 1 vaccine, 80.6% (95% CI, 78.8%-83.0%) reported that their child had received all vaccines when recommended and 86.5% (95% CI, 84.7%-88.2%) reported that their child would receive remaining vaccines when recommended. Respondents who considered not following recommendations, but ultimately did, cited the physician\\'s recommendation as the reason for vaccinating. Most vaccinators who reported past or planned deviations from recommendations cited only 1 vaccine that they would refuse and/or delay; all vaccines were mentioned. These parents reported approaching vaccination with serious concerns, while believing other parents did not. All parents cited \"vaccine side effects\" as their top question or concern. Almost all parents talked to a doctor or nurse about vaccines and, overall, satisfaction with communication was high. CONCLUSIONS: Communication about vaccines is important to most parents, but may be challenging for providers, because parental choices vary; thus, efforts to improve and support vaccine communication by providers should continue.',\n",
       " 'We assessed the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating pregnant women against seasonal influenza in England and Wales, taking into account the timing of vaccination relative to both the influenza season and trimester of pregnancy. Women were assumed to be vaccinated in their second or third trimester. Vaccination between September and December was found to have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £23,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) (95% CI £10,000-£140,000) if it is assumed that infants are partially protected through their mothers, and of £28,000 per QALY gained (95% CI £13,000-£200,000) if infants are not protected. If some vaccine protection lasts for a second season, then the ratio is only £15,000 per QALY gained (95% CI £6,000-£93,000). Most of the benefit of vaccination is in preventing symptomatic episodes, regardless of health care resource use. Extending vaccination beyond December is unlikely to be cost-effective unless there is good protection into a second influenza season. Key sources of uncertainty are the cost of vaccine delivery and the quality of life detriment due to a clinically apparent episode of confirmed influenza. The cost of vaccine purchase itself is relatively low.',\n",
       " 'These are the results of 417 primary vaccinations against smallpox with MVA, an attenuated vaccine. All of the patients were over three years old. In Europe, this group has an increased risk of postvaccinal encephalitis. The intracutaneous inoculation produced a light local infiltration and only 11.7% showed a light generalized reaction. In order to attain a reliable immunity, a second inoculation was performed one week later, epicutaneously with Elstree-vaccine. The local reaction was in general that of a normal revaccination, and 79.4% of our patients had neither fever nor general symptoms. Among the others no one became seriously ill. We did not observe any complications specific for a smallpox vaccination. In comparison to the other vaccination methods currently used, the MVA \"Two-step\"-vaccination is probably the safest. Its risk of a postvaccinal encephalitis is supposed to be lower according to animal experiments and theoretical considerations. This hypothesis has been confirmed meanwhile by the results of several thousand vaccinations in the already mentioned age-group.',\n",
       " \"The first HIV/AIDS vaccines are likely to be expensive and limited in supply, and developing countries with generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics will need to distribute the limited vaccine stock in a manner that is both efficient and practical. This analysis compares seven strategies for distributing an HIV/AIDS vaccine in different South African sub-populations, using a mathematical model. If vaccination is not coupled with HIV screening, vaccination of 16-year olds in school is likely to be the most efficient strategy for averting HIV infections in the short term. If coupled with screening, vaccination of sex workers and patients seeking STD treatment would be more efficient, but these gains in efficiency would have to be weighed against the practical challenges associated with vaccinating 'high risk' groups and conducting screening.\",\n",
       " 'In this paper we examine different time periods after vaccinations and investigate whether the risk of sudden infant death is different during the post-vaccination period than at other times. Three already published case-control studies are re-examined in this context. Several evaluation approaches are presented. The recently developed self-controled case series (SCCS) method for terminal events, which only takes the cases into account, is used in addition. There is no increased or reduced risk of sudden infant death during the period after the vaccination. The previously reported protective effect seen in case contol studies is based on the inclusion of unvaccinated cases. The results of the case-control analysis of one study is affected by two confounders. The SCCS method for terminal events, in which all time-independent confounders are eliminated, is an alternative to case-control analysis when it comes to the temporal association between exposed time periods and SIDS after vaccination.',\n",
       " 'Three new vaccines have been recommended for adolescents by the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) since 2005: meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4; 1 dose), tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap; 1 dose), and quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4; 3 doses). ACIP also recommends that adolescents should receive recommended vaccinations that were missed during childhood. Since 2006, CDC has conducted the National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen) to estimate vaccination coverage from a national sample of adolescents aged 13-17 years. This report describes the findings from NIS-Teen 2007, which indicated substantial increases in receipt of new adolescent vaccinations compared with 2006, including Tdap (from 10.8% to 30.4%) and MCV4 (from 11.7% to 32.4%), and increases in coverage with childhood vaccinations, including measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), hepatitis B (HepB), and varicella (VAR) (among those without disease history). An assessment of HPV4 coverage, which is reported for the first time, showed that 25.1% of adolescent females initiated the vaccine series (>/=1 dose) in 2007. To improve vaccination coverage among adolescents, health-care providers should take advantage of every health-care visit as an opportunity to evaluate vaccination status and administer vaccines when needed.',\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: In Japan, the bivalent HPV vaccine was approved in October, 2009 and became available as a non-routine vaccine from December, 2009. While routine vaccinations are free, the cost and responsibility for non-routine vaccinations are left to the individual. In exceptional circumstances regional governments fund non-routine vaccinations. This was the case in Shiki City, Saitama Prefecture, where a high uptake rate for individual (non-school based) HPV vaccination was obtained. MATERIALS: On January 20, 2010, the mayor of Shiki City announced to the media his decision to vaccinate adolescent girls in Shiki City against HPV. A project team for HPV vaccination was set up in the city's Health Promotion Center. To gain mutual consent for HPV vaccination, senior health professionals, city officials, the head of the board of education, school principals and health-care teachers met several times. The cohort to be vaccinated was 1254 girls aged 12-15 years. Individual notifications were mailed to each girl on April 23, 2010, along with information about the HPV vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: As of April 10th, 2011, the uptake rate for girls aged 15 years old was 90.7% for the 1st dose. The vaccine registry is managed by the health care system of the city. The success of the HPV vaccination program and high uptake rates in Shiki City is a good model for the nationwide HPV vaccination program that started in February, 2011.\",\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Economic evidence on how much it may cost for vaccinators to reach populations is important to plan vaccination programs. Moreover, knowing the incremental costs to reach populations that have traditionally been undervaccinated, especially those hard-to-reach who are facing supply-side barriers to vaccination, is essential to expanding immunization coverage to these populations. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to identify estimates of costs associated with getting vaccinators to all vaccination sites. We searched PubMed and the Immunization Delivery Cost Catalogue (IDCC) in 2019 for the following costs to vaccinators: (1) training costs; (2) labor costs, per diems, and incentives; (3) identification of vaccine beneficiary location; and (4) travel costs. We assessed if any of these costs were specific to populations that are hard-to-reach for vaccination, based on a framework for examining supply-side barriers to vaccination. RESULTS: We found 19 studies describing average vaccinator training costs at $0.67/person vaccinated or targeted (SD $0.94) and $0.10/dose delivered (SD $0.07). The average cost for vaccinator labor and incentive costs across 29 studies was $2.15/dose (SD $2.08). We identified 13 studies describing intervention costs for a vaccinator to know the location of a beneficiary, with an average cost of $19.69/person (SD $26.65), and six studies describing vaccinator travel costs, with an average cost of $0.07/dose (SD $0.03). Only eight of these studies described hard-to-reach populations for vaccination; two studies examined incremental costs per dose to reach hard-to-reach populations, which were 1.3-2 times higher than the regular costs. The incremental cost to train vaccinators was $0.02/dose, and incremental labor costs for targeting hard-to-reach populations were $0.16-$1.17/dose. CONCLUSION: Additional comparative costing studies are needed to understand the potential differential costs for vaccinators reaching the vaccination sites that serve hard-to-reach populations. This will help immunization program planners and decision-makers better allocate resources to extend vaccination programs.',\n",
       " 'The number of patients whose immune responses are impaired is increasing over the years due to larger use of immunosuppressive therapies aiming at treating malignant, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. These patients are at high risk of infections, many of which are preventable by vaccination. However, this population is often under-vaccinated because of negligence but also of concerns regarding the safety of these vaccines, the potential risk of exacerbation of underlying disease or vaccine efficacy. In this article, we are trying to stratify different patient groups based on different immunosuppressive treatments and to present adequate vaccination schemes according to the recommendations found in medical literature.',\n",
       " 'A random sample of 232 U.S. hospitals was surveyed. Of those hospitals, 75 percent had hepatitis B vaccination programs. The presence of a program was associated with hospital size (60 percent of those with 100 beds, 75 percent with 100-499 beds, 90 percent with 500 or more beds; P = 0.0013) and hospital location (urban 86 percent; rural 57 percent; P less than 0.001). The frequency of needlestick exposures per month among hospital personnel and hospital location were directly related to and best predicted the existence of hepatitis B vaccination programs. All hospitals with programs offered vaccine to high-risk personnel (as defined by the hospital). Seventy-seven percent of hospitals paid all costs for vaccinating high-risk personnel; 19 percent paid for any employee to be vaccinated regardless of risk status. Forty-six percent of hospitals with programs were estimated to have vaccinated more than 10 percent of all eligible personnel, and 13 percent to have vaccinated more than 25 percent of eligible personnel. The highest compliance rates were associated with hospitals paying for the vaccine and requiring vaccination of high-risk personnel. Fifty-four percent of hospitals attributed noncompliance to concern regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness. The reasons why there was no vaccination program in 58 hospitals were (a) low incidence of hepatitis B virus infections among personnel, (b) cost of vaccine, and (c) vaccination being offered as part of a needlestick protocol. Full utilization of hepatitis B vaccine could eliminate the occupational hazard that hepatitis B virus presents to health care personnel.',\n",
       " 'In a further vaccination and laboratory study with two dried smallpox vaccines (designated \"P\" and \"Q\") and one glycerinated vaccine, the potency of samples of each vaccine was deliberately lowered by exposure to heat. Groups of volunteers were vaccinated with the fully potent vaccines and with those of reduced potency. All subjects who developed a vesicular response were challenged one year later by revaccination with a potent vaccine, and the results obtained in the different groups were compared. No significant variation could be detected in the response of the different groups to the challenge vaccination. These findings indicate that if vesiculation is obtained with a vaccine, even though potency has been reduced to a point where it produces less than 50% successful primary vaccinations, satisfactory protection will result one year later. It also appears that successful vaccination with a dried vaccine confers as good immunity as that obtained from glycerinated lymph. Vaccines with a pock count of 10(6) infective units per millilitre will produce about 40% successes in primary vaccination.',\n",

       " \"The Advisory Committee on Vaccines of the Spanish Association of Paediatrics (CAV-AEP) updates the immunisation schedule every year, taking into account epidemiological data as well as evidence on the safety, effectiveness and efficiency of vaccines. The present schedule includes levels of recommendation. We have graded as routine vaccinations those that the CAV-AEP consider all children should receive; as recommended those that fit the profile for universal childhood immunisation and would ideally be given to all children, but that can be prioritised according to the resources available for their public funding; and as risk group vaccinations those that specifically target individuals in situations of risk. Immunisation schedules tend to be dynamic and adaptable to ongoing epidemiological changes. Nevertheless, the achievement of a unified immunisation schedule in all regions of Spain is a top priority for the CAV-AEP. Based on the latest epidemiological trends, CAV-AEP follows the innovations proposed in the last year's schedule, such as the administration of the first dose of the MMR and the varicella vaccines at age 12 months and the second dose at age 2-3 years, as well as the administration of the Tdap vaccine at age 4-6 years, always followed by another dose at 11-14 years of age, preferably at 11-12 years. The CAV-AEP believes that the coverage of vaccination against human papillomavirus in girls aged 11-14 years, preferably at 11-12 years, must increase. It reasserts its recommendation to include vaccination against pneumococcal disease in the routine immunisation schedule. Universal vaccination against varicella in the second year of life is an effective strategy and therefore a desirable objective. Vaccination against rotavirus is recommended in all infants due to the morbidity and elevated healthcare burden of the virus. The Committee stresses the need to vaccinate population groups considered at risk against influenza and hepatitis A. Finally, it emphasizes the need to bring incomplete vaccinations up to date following the catch-up immunisation schedule.\",\n",

This study compared the pre- and postvaccinal milk production levels of dairy cows vaccinated with two commercial vaccines or injected with a saline placebo. Dairy cows receiving vaccine C (Cattlemaster Gold FP5; Pfizer Animal Health, Montreal, Canada) experienced a statistically significant difference in mean postvaccinal milk drop (-1.83 kg/cow/day) compared with cows receiving vaccine T (Triangle 4+Type 2 BVD, Wyeth Animal Health, Guelph, Ontario, Canada; -0.63 kg/cow/day) or saline (-0.02 kg/cow/day).',\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: The Department of Defense is actively engaged in the research and development of vaccine(s) to mitigate the burden of disease associated with diarrhea among deployed troops. Soldiers' attitudes and beliefs toward predeployment vaccines and participation in experimental research with vaccines are unknown. METHODS: To assess these attitudes, a survey was distributed among soldiers who had been and were currently deployed to Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of soldiers believe that predeployment vaccines are important, and 21% are hesitant to receive these vaccinations. Fifteen percent of soldiers stated that they would be willing to enroll in a study evaluating experimental vaccines, and 14% stated that they would participate in military research for vaccine development. Both male and female soldiers agreed that predeployment vaccines were important (86 and 92%, respectively); however, compared to their male counterparts, females were more hesitant to receive routine vaccinations (45% vs 37%) and less likely to volunteer for an experimental vaccine study (12% vs 20%). Officers and Air Force personnel were less hesitant to receive routine vaccinations compared to enlisted and other service personnel, respectively. Furthermore, if a soldier experienced three or more episodes of diarrhea, he or she was more likely to try an experimental vaccine to prevent diarrhea (23% vs 13%, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A disconnect exists between the belief that immunizations are important and the hesitancy to receive them. Future studies should be directed to understand this gap and emphasize the critical importance of vaccines for health of US personnel in garrison and on deployment.\",\n",
       " 'Since 2000, approximately 50,000 refugees have entered the United States each year from various regions of the world. Although persons with immigrant status are legally required to be vaccinated before entering the United States, this requirement does not extend to U.S.-bound persons with refugee status. After 1 year in the United States, refugees can apply for a change of status to that of legal permanent resident, at which time they are required to be fully vaccinated in accordance with recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). A potentially less costly alternative might be to vaccinate U.S.-bound refugees overseas routinely, before they depart from refugee camps. To compare the cost of vaccinating refugees overseas versus after their arrival in the United States, CDC analyzed 2005 data on the number of refugees, cost of vaccine, and cost of vaccine administration. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which suggested that, in 2005, vaccinating 50,787 refugees overseas would have cost an estimated $7.7 million, less than one third of the estimated $26.0 million cost of vaccinating in the United States. Costs were calculated from the perspective of the U.S. health-care system. To achieve public health cost savings, routine overseas vaccination of U.S.-bound refugees should be considered.',\n",
       " \"AIM: Rotavirus vaccines are effective against severe infections, but have a modest impact on mortality in high-income countries. Parental knowledge and attitudes towards vaccines are crucial for high vaccination coverage. This study aimed to identify why parents refused to let their infant have the vaccination or were unsure. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was based on 1,063 questionnaires completed by the parents of newborn children in 2014. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify the main predictors. RESULTS: Most (81%) parents intended to vaccinate their child against the rotavirus, while 19% were unwilling or uncertain. Parents with less education and children up to five weeks of age were more likely to be unwilling or uncertain about vaccinating their child. Factors associated with a refusal or uncertainty about vaccinating were not having enough information about the vaccine, no intention of accepting other vaccines, paying little heed to the child health nurses' recommendations, thinking that the rotavirus was not a serious illness and not believing that the vaccine provided protection against serious forms of gastroenteritis. CONCLUSION: Early information, extra information for parents with less education and close positive relationships between parents and child health nurses were important factors in high rotavirus vaccination rates.\",\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: The number of recommended immunizations during childhood has increased significantly over the years. Today, infants receive vaccines against 11 diseases in the first 2 years of life, and may receive as many as 5 injections at a single office visit. For a number of reasons, some injections may be deferred to a later visit, thus creating a missed opportunity for vaccination. OBJECTIVE: To review benefits of pediatric combination vaccines. RESULTS: Combination vaccines that protect against several diseases, such as the new DTaP-HepB-IPV (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Hepatitis B [Recom-binant] and Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine Combined) vaccine, can help to simplify the current immunization schedule. Other benefits of combination vaccines for parents and healthcare providers include decreased anxiety because of perceived reduction in pain for the infant, fewer missed opportunities to vaccinate, convenience, and decreased costs for the parent as a result of fewer office visits. Benefits of using combination vaccines in the office setting include reduced missed opportunities to vaccinate, storage of fewer vials, decreased risk of needle sticks as a result of handling fewer syringes, and potentially improved record keeping and tracking. Benefits of using combination vaccines in managed care include improved member satisfaction and lower costs because of fewer vaccine administration charges, and potentially fewer office visits. CONCLUSIONS: Combination vaccines are an effective means of decreasing the number of injections and simplifying the immunization schedule, thus providing overall benefits to infants, parents, healthcare providers, office managers, and managed care administrators.',\n",

       " \"OBJECTIVES: To elicit information about parents' knowledge, attitudes, and acceptability toward HPV infection and vaccination of male adolescents in Italy; to identify subgroups of this population who exhibit poor knowledge about prevention of HPV infection and reveal negative attitudes toward HPV vaccination in relation to their male sons. STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected via self-administered anonymous questionnaire from 1021 parents of males aged 10 to 14 y who were recruited from a random sample of public secondary schools in the South of Italy. RESULTS: Three-quarters (72.6%) reported that the vaccine is a preventive measure for HPV infection and 55.8% that condom use reduces the risk of HPV infection. A high education level, abundant sources of information about HPV infection received from physicians, and knowledge about HPV infection were factors significantly associated with high level of knowledge about preventive measures for HPV infection. 71% revealed their intentions to vaccinate their sons, and this intention was significantly associated with perceived benefits both for HPV vaccination for girls and for childhood recommended vaccinations as well as a need for additional information about HPV vaccination. 53.7% of the eligible parents reported that their daughters had been vaccinated against HPV. CONCLUSION: Results of the study suggest that the risk of acquiring HPV infection and HPV-related diseases is sorely underestimated. Knowledge on the benefits of adolescents' HPV vaccination in cancer prevention in both sexes should be improved to maximize uptake of HPV vaccination.\",\n",
       " 'Using a population-based self-controlled case series design, we examined data on children born between the years 2002 and 2009 in the province of Ontario, Canada. We specifically examined how socioeconomic status (SES) influences rates of adverse events following immunization (AEFI), defined as emergency room visits and / or hospital admissions. For vaccination at 2, 4 and 6 mo combined, the relative incidence of AEFI (95% CI) in the first 72 h after vaccination was 0.69 (0.67 to 0.71). For all three vaccinations combined, we observed no relationship between the relative incidence of an event and quintile of socioeconomic status (p = 0.1433). For the 12-mo vaccination alone, the relative incidence of events (95% CI) on days 4 to 12 following immunization was 1.35 (1.31 to 1.38). We observed a significant relationship between socioeconomic status and vaccination at 12 mo, with lower SES being associated with a higher relative incidence of events (p = 0.0075). When the lowest 2 quintiles of income combined were compared with the highest 3 quintiles, the relative incidence ratio (95% CI) was 0.94 (0.89 to 0.99, p = 0.02). These results translate to 150 additional adverse events in the lower SES quintiles as compared with the higher SES quintiles for every 100,000 children vaccinated, or 1 additional event for every 666 individuals vaccinated. Future studies should explore potential explanations for this observation.',\n",
       " 'In the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 influenza seasons, 84 pediatric offices participating in a prospective observational study were surveyed about whether the office offered influenza vaccine to parents and guardians of pediatric patients. Each season, approximately half of all offices cited offering seasonal influenza vaccine to parents. In 2008-2009, reported barriers to parental vaccination included reimbursement, medicolegal concerns, and logistics. In 2009-2010, 51% of offices (n = 43) administered one parental seasonal vaccination for every 29 pediatric seasonal vaccinations and one parental H1N1 vaccination for every 23 pediatric H1N1 vaccinations. Currently, the number of parental vaccinations per office is small but parental vaccination by pediatricians may increase in the future given the new recommendations that all adults 18 to 49 years of age should be vaccinated annually. Efforts should be taken to address barriers to parental vaccination so that pediatricians are better able to vaccinate parents/guardians of their patients against influenza.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed in unprecedented time. However, the effectiveness of any vaccine is dictated by the proportion of the population willing to be vaccinated. This observational population-based study examines intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 throughout the pandemic. METHODS: In November 2020, longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of 7,547 U.S. adults enrolled in the Understanding America Study were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. Participants reported being willing, undecided, and unwilling to get vaccinated against COVID-19 across 13 assessments conducted from April to October 2020. Public attitudes to vaccination against COVID-19 were also assessed on a 4-point Likert-type scale. RESULTS: Willingness to vaccinate declined from 71% in April to 53.6% in October. This was explained by an increase in the percentage of participants undecided about vaccinating (from 10.5% to 14.4%) and the proportion of the sample unwilling to vaccinate (from 18.5% to 32%). The population subgroups most likely to be undecided/unwilling to vaccinate were those without a degree (undecided: RR=2.47, 95% CI=2.04, 3.00; unwilling: RR=1.92, 95% CI=1.67, 2.20), Black participants (undecided: RR=2.18, 95% CI=1.73, 2.74; unwilling: RR=1.98, 95% CI=1.63, 2.42), and female participants (undecided: RR=1.41, 95% CI=1.20, 1.65; unwilling: RR=1.29, 95% CI=1.14, 1.46). Participants who were older or were on higher incomes were least likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate. Concerns about potential side effects of a vaccine were common. CONCLUSIONS: Intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 have declined rapidly during the pandemic, and close to half of Americans are undecided or unwilling to be vaccinated.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Immunization is one of the most cost-effective health interventions, but as countries introduce new vaccines and scale-up immunization coverage, costs will likely increase. This paper updates estimates of immunization costs and financing based on information from comprehensive multi-year plans (cMYPs) from GAVI-eligible countries during a period when countries planned to introduce a range of new vaccines (2008-2016). METHODS: The analysis database included information from baseline and 5-year projection years for each country cMYP, resulting in a total sample size of 243 observations. Two-thirds were from African countries. Cost data included personnel, vaccine, injection, transport, training, maintenance, cold chain and other capital investments. Financing from government and external sources was evaluated. All estimates were converted to 2010 US Dollars. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA, and results were population-weighted. RESULTS: Results pertain to country planning estimates. Average annual routine immunization cost was $62 million. Vaccines continued to be the major cost driver (51%) followed by immunization-specific personnel costs (22%). Non-vaccine delivery costs accounted for almost half of routine program costs (44%). Routine delivery cost per dose averaged $0.61 and the delivery cost per infant was $10. The cost per DTP3 vaccinated child was $27. Routine program costs increased with each new vaccine introduced. Costs accounted for 5% of government health expenditures. Governments accounted for 67% of financing. CONCLUSION: Total and average costs of routine immunization programs are rising as coverage rates increase and new vaccines are introduced. The cost of delivering vaccines is nearly equivalent to the cost of vaccines. Governments are financing greater proportions of the immunization program but there may be limits in resource scarce countries. Price reductions for new vaccines will help reduce costs and the burden of financing. Strategies to improve efficiency in service delivery should be pursued.',\n",
       " \"Between 1 May 1998 and 22 February 1999, it was compulsory for Dutch cattle farmers to take measures against bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1). Cattle on farms that were not certified as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR)-free had to be vaccinated twice a year. During the vaccination programme, both farmers and veterinarians reported side-effects of the vaccine. These reports were collected by the Stichting IBR/BVD Schade (SIS; Foundation for IBR/BVD Damage) in order to draw up a damage report. In 1999 in total 6977 cattle farmers lodged complaints which they considered to be related to the vaccination against BHV1. On these farms, 15,150 herd vaccinations had been performed, 10,269 of which were associated with one or more symptoms. During the compulsory vaccination period, 13% of the herd vaccinations led to symptoms and complaints. In March 1999, a number of vaccine batches were found to be contaminated with bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD) virus. For the purposes of this analysis, a 'known contaminated' herd vaccination was defined as one in which at least one 'known contaminated' batch or lot of vaccine was used. In total, 987 of 1007 herds vaccinated with 'known contaminated' vaccines developed one or more symptoms compatible with acute BVD. There were no commonly seen combinations of symptoms. For this reason, and because the start and end dates were not reported for 55% of the symptoms, it was not possible to detect a symptom pattern. Therefore there were no 'suspect' batches of vaccine which, although not contaminated with BVD virus, gave rise to symptoms. The number of BVD symptoms was determined for those herds with vaccination-related symptoms. There was no difference in the distribution frequency between batch numbers or between 'known contaminated' batches and 'non-suspect' batches. The farmers' definition of chronic wasting was used in this investigation, with the inevitable large differences in definition. The symptom chronic 'wasting' was reported for 3209 of the 10,269 herds with vaccination-related symptoms. On 161 farms (164 herd vaccinations) 'chronic wasting' accounted for more than 20% of the symptoms. As expected, other symptoms were reported in addition to wasting. The symptom 'chronic wasting' was reported more often on forms where a 'known contaminated' vaccine was used. Inactivated vaccine was used for 154 herd vaccinations. In 34 cases, one or more symptoms of acute BVD were reported. The frequency was the same as that for live vaccines. The frequency of reported symptoms tended to be lower with the inactivated vaccine. On the basis of the SIS data, no relationship was found between vaccine batch and reported symptoms. This may be because (i) the classification of a vaccine as 'known contaminated', 'non-suspect', and 'not known' may not have been in keeping with the real status of the vaccine, (ii) farmers may have reported symptoms selectively, and (iii) there is no relationship with vaccination against BHV1.\",\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to (a) assess knowledge of official vaccination recommendations and attitudes towards vaccinations among adults and (b) examine their association with vaccination uptake among adults. METHODS: This study was part of the HaBIDS study (Hygiene and Behaviour Infectious Diseases Survey), which is an online panel established in March 2014 in Lower Saxony, Germany with males and females aged between 15 and 69\\u202fyears (n\\u202f=\\u202f2379). Every few months, participants completed questionnaires on different aspects of infectious diseases. In September 2014, knowledge of vaccination recommendations, attitudes towards vaccinations and information on uptake of vaccinations in the last 10\\u202fyears (practice) were collected using a knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP) questionnaire. Multiple correspondence analysis was applied to identify underlying structures in each KAP domain and fractional polynomial regression analysis to examine the associations of knowledge and attitudes with vaccination uptake. RESULTS: Of the 2379 panel members, 1698 (71%) completed the KAP questionnaire on vaccinations. The majority of participants (80%) knew that the vaccine against diphtheria and tetanus should be administered every 10\\u202fyears. Regarding other recommendations, the proportion of correct answers varied between 35% and 60%. 82% of participants agreed that adult vaccinations should be mandatory for selected groups such as health care workers and 40% stated that vaccinations should be mandatory for all adults. For the different vaccines, the odds of being unvaccinated were 1.5- to 5-times higher among participants with poor knowledge of vaccination recommendations compared to participants with good knowledge. Participants with negative attitudes towards vaccinations were also more likely to be unvaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts should be undertaken to improve knowledge of official vaccination recommendations in the general population and reduce common misconceptions about vaccinations. This information can be provided during general practitioner visits or through media campaigns.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The high visibility of controversies regarding vaccination makes it increasingly important to understand how parents decide whether to vaccinate their infants. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to investigate decision-making about vaccinations for infants. DESIGN: We conducted qualitative, open-ended interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects included mothers 1 to 3 days postpartum and again at 3 to 6 months. RESULTS: We addressed 3 topics: attitudes to vaccination, knowledge about vaccination, and decision-making. Mothers who intended to have their infants vaccinated (\"vaccinators,\" n = 25) either agreed with or did not question vaccination or they accepted vaccination but had significant concerns. Mothers who did not intend to vaccinate (\"nonvaccinators,\" n = 8) either completely rejected vaccination or they purposely delayed vaccinating/chose only some vaccines. Knowledge about which vaccines are recommended for children was poor among both vaccinators and nonvaccinators. The theme of trust in the medical profession was the central concept that underpinned all of the themes about decision-making. Promoters of vaccination included trusting the pediatrician, feeling satisfied by the pediatrician\\'s discussion about vaccines, not wanting to diverge from the cultural norm, and wanting to adhere to the social contact. Inhibitors included feeling alienated by or unable to trust the pediatrician, having a trusting relationship with an influential homeopath/naturopath or other person who did not believe in vaccinating, worry about permanent side effects, beliefs that vaccine-preventable diseases are not serious, and feeling that since other children are vaccinated their child is not at risk. CONCLUSION: Trust or lack of trust and a relationship with a pediatrician or another influential person were pivotal for decision-making of new mothers about vaccinating their children. Attempts to work with mothers who are concerned about vaccinating their infants should focus not only on providing facts about vaccines but also on developing trusting and positive relationships.',\n",
       " \"Global childhood vaccination coverage has stagnated over the past decade and raising coverage will require a collection of approaches since no single approach has been suitable for all countries or situations. The American Red Cross has developed a 5-Point Plan(a) to geolocate under-vaccinated children and determine the reasons why they miss vaccination by capitalizing on the Red Cross Movement's large cadres of trusted community volunteers. The Plan was piloted in Bobasi sub-county in Western Kenya, with volunteers seeking to conduct a face-to-face interview in all households, visiting over 60,000 over 7\\xa0days. Six pockets of 233 children without a home-based vaccination record or missing an age-appropriate dose of Penta1, Penta3 or measles-containing vaccine were identified. Three activities were carried out to learn why these children were not vaccinated: 1) one-on-one interviews and 2) focus group discussions with the caregivers of the under-vaccinated children and 3) interviews with healthcare workers who vaccinate in Bobasi. Complacency was commonly reported by caregivers during one-on-one interviews while bad staff attitude or practice was most frequently reported in focus group discussions; health staff reported caregiver hesitency, not knowing vaccination due date and vaccine stock-outs as the most common reasons for caregivers to not have their child vaccinated. As reasons varied across the three different activities, the different perspectives and approaches helped characterize vaccination barriers. Civil society organizations working together with the Ministry of Health can provide valuable information for immunization managers to act on.\",\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: In its first large-scale smallpox vaccination campaign in the 20(th) century, Israel has experienced an exceptionally high rate of failure to achieve clinical take following vaccination. It was hypothesized that this failure rates might be attributed to the unique vaccination technique adopted in Israel, of using beveled needles rather than bifurcated needles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified two cohorts vaccinated in the defined dates during the Israeli revaccination campaign, in which beveled needles and bifurcated needles were used alternately, and studied the impact of different covariates on clinical vaccination outcome measures. RESULTS: Of 116 subjects that were vaccinated within the defined dates, 46 were vaccinated using bifurcated needles, and 70 by beveled needles. 'Take' rates in subjects vaccinated up to 20 years earlier was 77.5%, compared with 97.2% among those vaccinated in the more distant past (p = 0.001). In multivariate analyses, vaccination 'take' was independently associated with a shorter time from previous vaccination (p = 0.013), but not with gender, birth country, vaccinator or the vaccination technique used. CONCLUSIONS: The low take rates observed in the Israeli smallpox revaccination campaign could not be attributed to the unique local vaccination technique, and was most likely induced by a higher rate of residual immunity among vaccinees, compared with the US, as well as by the lower vaccine concentrations used in Israel. In countries and circumstances when bifurcated needles are not sufficiently available, the beveled needle technique may be considered an appropriate alternative.\",\n",
       " 'One alternative for management of brucellosis in Yellowstone National Park bison (Bison bison) is vaccination of calves and yearlings. Although Brucella abortus strain RB51 vaccination protects bison against experimental challenge, the effect of booster vaccinations was unknown. This study characterized immunologic responses after dart or booster vaccination of bison with Brucella abortus strain RB51. In two studies, 8- to 10-month-old female bison were inoculated with saline (n = 14), hand vaccinated with 1.1 × 10(10) to 2.0 × 10(10) CFU of RB51 (n = 21), or dart vaccinated with 1.8 × 10(10) CFU of RB51 (n = 7). A subgroup of hand vaccinates in study 1 was randomly selected for booster vaccination 15 months later with 2.2 × 10(10) CFU of RB51. Compared to single vaccinates, booster-vaccinated bison had greater serologic responses to RB51. However, there was a trend for antigen-specific proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from booster vaccinates to be reduced compared to responses of PBMC from single vaccinates. PBMC from booster vaccinates tended to have greater gamma interferon (IFN-γ) production than those from single vaccinates. In general, dart vaccination with RB51 induced immunologic responses similar to those of hand vaccination. All vaccinates (single hand, dart, or booster) demonstrated greater (P < 0.05) immunologic responses at various times after vaccination than nonvaccinated bison. Booster vaccination with RB51 in early gestation did not induce abortion or fetal infection. Our data suggest that booster vaccination does not induce strong anamnestic responses. However, phenotypic data on resistance to experimental challenge are required to fully assess the effect of booster vaccination on protective immunity.',\n",

They include variable schemes according to the vaccinal doses (hepatitis A, B, diphteria) or the number of injections (hepatitis A, B, rabies). Their goals are eradication (Measles, Mumps, Rubella), or immune maintenance by boosters (hepatitis A, poliomyelitis, tetanus). They introduce associated vaccines in the vaccinal calendar (diphteria, tetanus, poliomyelitis, pertussis, hemophilus b and hepatitis B). They enlarged the area of targeted vaccinations for at risk-professions or pathologies and for travellers.',\n",
       " 'The objective of the present study was to compare the effect of sow and/or piglet vaccination regimen by three commercial porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) vaccines on pigs experimentally challenged with PCV2 at 84 days of age based on immunological, virological, and pathological evaluation. One hundred and nineteen piglets born to vaccinated or non-vaccinated sows were divided into 17 groups. A portion of the pigs with or without passively acquired immunity was vaccinated at 21 or 49 days of age. Regardless of the PCV2 vaccine, the combination of sow and pig (49 days of age) vaccinations significantly (P<0.05) reduced PCV2 viremia, induced higher log2 transformed neutralizing antibody titers, and resulted in higher proportion of CD4(+)CD8(+)IFN-γ(+) lymphocyte subsets than the sow vaccination alone, the pig (21 or 49 days of age) vaccination alone, and the combination of sow and pig (21 days of age) vaccinations at various days post challenge. The results showed a significant negative correlation between maternally derived antibodies at the day of vaccination and the increment of antibody titers to PCV2 at 28 days post vaccination in the combination of sow and pig (21 days of age) vaccinations but not the combination of sow and pig (49 days of age) vaccinations. The combination of sow and pig (49 days of age) vaccinations could be more effective for controlling PCV2 infection if PCV2 the infection occurs during the growing-finishing period in herds. Optimal vaccination strategies must balance the advantage of delayed vaccination with the need to induce immunity prior to exposure to pathogens under field conditions.',\n",

       " 'Pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly people, especially in those with chronic medical conditions such as chronic heart and lung diseases. We prospectively examined the effect of influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations on the rate of hospitalization for and complications of pneumonia, all respiratory tract conditions and mortality in elderly bedridden patients and found that both febrile days and pneumonia cases decreased. Thus, these results show that it is valuable to vaccinate for influenza elderly people even if they are confined to bed. Furthermore, the tuberculin skin test is an easy method to check the cell-mediated immunity in the elderly people. In the tuberculin skin test, all Japanese over 65 years old should have positive status. A negative result indicates depressed cell-mediated immunity. We undertook a trial to vaccinate tuberculin negative elderly people with BCG vaccine and found that the risk of pneumonia is decreased to a similar degree to that in subjects with positive tuberculin test results. We conclude that vaccination might be an effective strategy for the prevention of pneumonia in elderly people with limited activities of daily living.',\n",
       " 'The aim of this study was to develop a strategy to control Newcastle disease (ND) in free ranging village chickens using the Nobilis ND Inkukhu vaccine (Intervet South Africa). The study was conducted at Thibella village in Qwa-Qwa, South Africa from April 2001 to October 2002. Three different routes of vaccination (administration via eye-drop, drinking water and feed) were investigated. The haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was conducted monthly in order to measure the antibody response of village chickens after immunization against Newcastle disease. Using a South African isolate of velogenic ND virus, challenge trials were conducted to determine the efficacy of the vaccine. A questionnaire was provided to evaluate perceptions of farmers on vaccinations. The eye-drop vaccination route produced the highest HI titres ranging between 2.7 and 4.4, followed by the drinking water vaccination route with titres ranging between 2.3 and 4.0. The lowest titres were from the feed vaccination route which ranged between 1.6 and 3.0. Following the challenge, the entire control group died on the third and fourth day after infection. However, 70% of the chickens immunized by using either the eye-drop or drinking water route survived the challenge. Only 20% of the chickens from the group immunized through the feed route survived. Evidently both the eye-drop and drinking water routes were efficient in preventing disease. Necropsies showed that vaccinated chickens had mild lesions whilst control chickens had severe lesions compatible with Newcastle disease. The efficacy of the vaccine using either of the routes can be enhanced by administration of booster vaccinations at 3-month intervals during the first year of a vaccination campaign and then at 6-month intervals from the second year onwards. The majority of the owners indicated that they would prefer to vaccinate their flocks using the drinking water route.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Since vaccinations are an effective prevention tool for maintaining the health of society, the monitoring of immunization coverage allows us to identify areas where disease outbreaks are likely to occur, and possibly assist us in predicting future outbreaks. The aim of this study is the investigation of the coverage achieved for compulsory (diphtheria, tetanus, polio, hepatitis B,) and recommended (pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, measles-mumps-rubella) vaccinations between 1998 and 2002 in the municipality of Bologna and the identification of the subjects not complying with compulsory and recommended vaccinations. METHODS: The statistics regarding vaccinal coverage were elaborated from the data supplied by the Bologna vaccinal registration system (1998-2000) and the IPV4 program (2001-2002). To calculate the coverage for compulsory vaccinations and cases of non-compliance reference was made to the protocol drawn up by the Emilia Romagna Regional Administration. The reasons for non-compliance were divided into various categories RESULTS: In Bologna the levels of immunization for the four compulsory vaccinations are satisfactory: over 95% children completed the vaccinal cycle, receiving the booster for anti-polio foreseen in their 3rd year and for anti-diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis at 6 years. The frequency of subjects with total non-compliance (i.e. those who have not begun any compulsory vaccinations by the age of one year) is generally higher in Bologna than in the region, with a slight increase in 2002 (2.52% and 1.06% in the city and the region respectively). The frequency of the anti-measles vaccination is higher than that of mumps and rubella, which means that the single vaccine, as opposed to the combined MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) was still being used in the period in question. The most common reason for non compliance is objection of parents and is probably due to reduction of certain diseases or anxiety about the possible risks. CONCLUSION: In Bologna the frequency of children aged 12 and 24 months who have achieved compulsory vaccination varied, in 2002, between 95% and 98%. As regards recommended vaccinations the percentage of coverage against Haemophilus influenzae is 93.3%, while the levels for measles, mumps and pertussis range from 84% to approx. 92%. Although these percentages are higher if compared to those obtained by other Italian regions, every effort should be made to strengthen the aspects that lead to a successful vaccinal strategy.',\n",

The aim of this article is to tender the practitioner criteria for making the best choice. Efficacy is the most important criterion when selecting a vaccine. The efficacy can be assessed by studying the results of well-designed vaccination-challenge experiments performed in the laboratory and of field trials. Safety is the second criterion for quality of vaccines. Other aspects that can influence the choice of a vaccine are: available documentation, the cost and biopharmaceutical data.

       " 'Vaccination of animals is indicated for cattle and sheep to prevent human infections deriving from these animals and inhibit the infertility in livestock. Both phase I and phase II are available. Vaccination is successful only when animals had been vaccinated as noninfected young, i. e. calves or lambs. Corpuscular vaccines are prevalent in immunoprophylaxis of domestic animals against coxiellosis. Such vaccines consist of formalin--inactivated, purified corpuscules Coxiella burnetii in phase I or phase II suspended in isotonic saline. But only complete composition of particles Coxiella burnetii secures their immunogenicity. We assume that any vaccine prepared from phase II Coxiella burnetii can not be equivalent to a vaccine prepared from phase I Coxiella burnetii. We tried to ascertain the optimal dose of Q-fever vaccine Coxiella burnetii, strain Nine Mile phase I, for the immunization of cattle. The vaccine is called BODIBION and it is commercially produced by BIOVETA in Nitra, Czechoslovakia. It is recommended to vaccinate by Coxiella--free herds of cattle the heifers from the age of 3 months with a dose of 200 micrograms of vaccine with the possibility either to revaccinate with the same dose, i. e. 200 micrograms 3-4 weeks after the first dose, or to vaccinate with only a single dose, i. e. 200 micrograms, but with the addition of adjuvans. In Q-fever infested herds it is recommended to vaccinate with 500 micrograms of vaccine with the possibility of either to revaccinate after 3-4 weeks with a lower dose, i. e. 200 micrograms of vaccine, or to vaccinate with a single dose of 500 micrograms vaccine with the addition of adjuvans. The administration of adjuvans in the vaccination process seems to be perspective in the development of vaccines against coxiellosis in domestic animals. Its involvement may lower the recently used vaccination dose and may avoid the revaccination.',\n",

To facilitate the efficient delivery of such vaccine aerosols to large animals, an electro-mechanical device was developed to synchronize aerosol release to an animal's inhalation cycles. The device was tested for its capacity to deliver a fluorescein conjugate of this bacterin (FITC-S. suis) into the respiratory tracts of 18 pigs. Results showed that FITC-S. suis could be detected in the lungs of swine as small as 4.5 kg with as few as two aerosol actuations. Metered-dose propellant-driven aerosols of bacterin vaccines delivered by this respiratory vaccinating device are discussed as a new approach for stimulated mucosal immunity against respiratory infections in animals.\",\n",

Therefore it is recommended to vaccinate them in time at the same chronological age as full term infants. Several reports have shown that vaccinations of very and extreme low birth weight infants are often delayed but till now there are no data for Germany. Our study analysed the vaccination rates and suffered complications of 318 preterm infants with birth weights under 1 500 g at the age of 2 years from all over the country copying their vaccination-record and asking the parents to answer a questionnaire. The preterm infants received the first 3 doses of the pentavalent or hexavalent vaccines consequently (1st dose: 100%, 2nd dose: 100%, 3rd dose: 97.5%), whereas the booster dose was accomplished to a lesser extent (89.0%) during their second year of life. The majority of the vaccinations were administered delayed. Moreover, the preterm infants received the first doses of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine quite consequently, but the booster dose was again injected less frequent. According to their parents 17.8% of these preterm infants suffered from non-severe adverse reactions and none of them had an episode of apnoea following the immunisation. In conclusion preterm infants in Germany receive their basic immunisations consequently, but often too late. There is still the need to improve the frequency of the booster dose application especially in the second year of life and to prevent delays of vaccinations.',\n",

In France, the High Council for Public Health published on September 28th 2012 a new guideline decreasing the age of vaccination from 16 to between 11 to 14 allowing a joint vaccination with mandatory tetravalent or trivalent (against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and poliomyelitis Tdap-IPV or Td/IPV booster) vaccination. Our study aimed to assess if this guideline changed the rate of joint vaccinations. METHODS: A descriptive before/after study was conducted on French health insurance reimbursement database at the regional level (Midi-Pyrénées area). The study period comprised 1 year before and 1 year after the publication of the new guideline. We assess the rate of co-vaccinations in these 2 periods and compared them by a Chi(2) test. RESULTS: On the study period, 35,647 vaccines were reimbursed corresponding to 18,230 complete vaccinations. Concerning co-vaccinations, 3287 were reimbursed: 1406 (16.4%) before the publication of the guideline and 1881 (19.4%) after (P<0.01). DISCUSSION: The new guideline was accompanied by a rapid increase in the rate of co-vaccinations. It did not diminish the rate of vaccination by antipapillomavirus.',\n",

       " 'AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the vaccination coverage among the medical and paramedical health care workers of the pediatric intensive care and emergency department of Edouard Herriot hospital in Lyon, with respect to influenza, pertussis, varicella, and measles, 4 diseases with air transmission and vaccination recommendations. METHOD: During February and March 2007, a questionnaire was given by hand to 123 health care workers by a medical student working there or available in the intensive care unit. RESULTS: The response rate to the questionnaire was 68.3%. The vaccination coverage against influenza was 42.8%; men and medical health care workers were better vaccinated. With respect to vaccination against pertussis, one third had received an injection in adulthood, adults under age 30 and medical health care workers were better vaccinated, but the difference was not statistically significant. Ten health care workers were not vaccinated and had no history of measles: only 1 had had a measles serology and none were vaccinated. Eleven had no history of varicella: 6 had had a varicella serology and none were vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination coverage against influenza is higher than what has been reported in the literature, possibly because of a mobile vaccination campaign against influenza made during winter 2006 in this pediatric department. Vaccination coverage against pertussis is encouraging and probably the consequence of an awareness of the gravity of the disease among infants. Individual information is necessary for health care workers on the nosocomial risk for influenza and pertussis in infants, and vaccination must be proposed. Serology against varicella and measles is compulsory for all health care workers with no history and no vaccination against these 2 diseases, to track and vaccinate the nonimmunized personnel. Occupational physicians have a very important role to play in meeting this goal.',\n",
       " \"Results are given for one of a series of projects designed to investigate the relation between observable post-vaccination responses and acquired resistance to tuberculosis. Controlled variations in the dose of BCG vaccine have previously been shown to cause systematic variations in the degree of skin sensitivity to tuberculin and the size of vaccinal lesions in human beings: the purpose of the present project was to see if similar variations would be produced in guinea-pigs and then, by infecting the animals with virulent tubercle bacilli, to see how survival time correlates with tuberculin allergy and vaccinal lesions.Four doses of freshly prepared BCG vaccine, ranging from 1/100 to 10 times the dose ordinarily used for intradermal vaccination of humans, and one dose of heat-killed BCG 100 times that strength, were used to vaccinate five groups of guinea-pigs, each containing 120 animals. A sixth group of 120 animals was not vaccinated. All animals were tuberculin-tested just before and five weeks after vaccination, challenged with a strong dose of H-37 Rv, and then allowed to die, so that survival time could be used as a measure of resistance.As the dose of living BCG was increased, groups of guinea-pigs showed a progressive increase in the average degree of post-vaccination tuberculin allergy, size of vaccinal lesion, and length of survival after virulent infection. The heat-killed BCG resulted in weak allergy and a short survival time, yet the vaccinal lesions averaged about as large as would be expected from a corresponding dose of living BCG. These results (excluding studies of survival time) correspond closely to those found in human studies.The implications of the results with respect to practical BCG vaccination programmes, while no more than speculative at present, point toward possible advantages in inducing high degrees of tuberculin allergy and toward the dubious significance of the vaccinal lesion as an index of a vaccine's immunizing potency.\",\n",

The purpose of the work was to evaluate the results of primary vaccination as well as the first revaccination by DPT,OPV and MMR vaccines. WORK METHOD: Descriptive epidemiological study was used. The investigation was done in the Primary Health Center in Nis and it involved all the children who were born in 2000, 2001, 2006 and 2007. WORK RESULTS: A total number of 1863 vaccination records were examened. In the sample of examened records of children who were born in 2000 and 2001, there were 155 children (12.05%) who were vaccinated with different vaccines and according to the different vaccination schedules. The number of childern born in 2006 and 2007 was slightly higher and it was (14.70%). In the first group (children who were born in 2000 and 2001) there were 43 children (4.51%) who were not vaccinated (3 children haven\\'t been vaccinated by DPT, and other 40 haven\\'t been vaccinated by MMR). Similar situation was in the second group (children who were born in 2006 and 2007) in which 37 children (4.03%) haven\\'t been vaccinated at all (3 of them by DPT and other 34 by MMR). In both observed groups DPT vaccine immunization started out late. 48.25% of children from the first group haven\\'t been vaccinated with the first dose of DPT on time. 58.53% of children born in 2006 and 2007 haven\\'t been vaccinated with the first dose of DPT on time. The first re-vaccination by DPT was also late in children born 2000 and 2001 (16.6% vs 45.36%). It was also delayed the first revaccination by MMR (10.3% vs 22.53%). DISCUSSION: To achieve the expected effects should be vaccinated at least 95% of planned persons but also make timely vaccinations. While the main goal of immunization is to prevent illness and death, the overriding concern of any public health intervention must be \"Primum non nocere\". CONCLUSION: A small number of post-vaccinal reactions is registered, and there haven\\'t been registered cases of adverse events following immunization or serious reactions that would be contraindications for further immunization.',\n",

Basing on the incidence of recorded damage caused by such vaccinations 1971-1990 we must conclude that the risk of damage to health as a result of such vaccinations is very remote. Hence, the protective vaccinations carried out in Germany are of vital importance in respect of keeping down the number of infections.',\n",

       " 'The aim of the directive is to define tests to be done by a manufacturer which are capable of providing as precise information as possible about the properties of the biological products concerning safety. These tests have to be done in the target species and the dose used should be that quantity of the product recommended for use and containing the maximum titre of potency. The samples for safety testing should be taken from a batch produced according to the manufacturing process. The vaccine is tested in normal conditions at the recommended dose and by each recommended route of administration to animals of each species and category it is intended to vaccinate. Objective criteria have to be recorded to measure possible adverse general and local effects. But tests in abnormal conditions of use may be necessary, such as administration of an overdose or repeated administration of one dose. Effects on reproductive function and progeny have to be studied as well as investigations which may be required in some cases to evaluate a possible adverse effect on the immunological function of the vaccinated animal. Special requirements seem to be appropriate for live vaccines: to evaluate the spread of the vaccinal strain from vaccinated to unvaccinated animals including, if necessary, wild species; to determine whether the vaccinal strain can disseminate in the vaccinated organism; to check for the absence of reversion to virulence of live stains especially for conventional vaccines. Field studies can therefore provide complementary information about safety.',\n",

One hundred ewe-lambs received B melitensis strain REV 1 vaccine subcutaneously and 100 others received Rev 1 vaccine conjunctivally. In each group, 50 ewe-lambs simultaneously received the S abortusovis strain Rv6 vaccine via a contralateral subcutaneous route. Reactions to Brucella antigens (estimated by allergic intrapalpebral reaction to brucellin, complement fixation test and Rose Bengal plate test) or to S abortusovis antigens (agglutination of O and H antigens) were recorded. Agglutinating titers against Salmonella antigens increased in all animals vaccinated with Abortusovis Rv6, whatever the route of the associated Rev1 vaccination. Rv6 vaccination did not interfere with serological or allergic responses to Rev 1 vaccination 1 month after vaccination. Six months after vaccination, no interference was observed with serological reactions to Rev 1 vaccination, which were still positive in about 10% of subcutaneously vaccinated ewes and negative in all conjunctivally vaccinated ewes. However, 6 months after vaccination, the frequencies of allergic responses to Rev 1 vaccine were significantly decreased by Rv6 vaccination in the Rev 1 subcutaneously vaccinated (45 versus 24%, P less than 0.05), but not in the Rev 1 conjunctivally vaccinated groups (12 versus 17%). According to these serological and allergic criteria, 1), association of the 2 vaccines does not appear to interfere with detection of Brucellosis more than by using a single anti-Brucella vaccination; 2), immunogenicity of each vaccinal valence was demonstrated after simultaneous vaccination; and 3), anti-Brucella serological and allergic responses remained in any case lower after conjunctival vaccination than after subcutaneous Rev 1 injection.',\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Economics has been suggested as a barrier to vaccination, but data that link clinician reports to actual immunization rates are limited. This study examined the relationship between clinicians' self-report regarding likelihood of vaccinating and actual age at vaccination from a registry of children seen by the clinicians. METHODS: Standardized telephone survey results of 29 providers were compared to the immunization records of children seeing these providers, using analysis of contingency tables (on time versus late) and conditional hierarchical linear models with log age at diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP)#3, DTP#4, and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR)#1 as the dependent variables. RESULTS: Children seeing providers likely to refer an uninsured child for immunization were vaccinated at a later log age at DTP#4 but not for DTP#3 or MMR#1 than children seeing providers unlikely to refer. Vaccination rates were higher for MMR#1 (77% versus 48%), DTP#3 (84% versus 71%), and DTP#4 (82% versus 66%) among providers who received free vaccine, compared with children seen by providers who did not receive free vaccine. These results remained significant in the hierarchical analyses. Providers likely to vaccinate an 18-month-old with watery diarrhea had higher vaccination rates than those unlikely to vaccinate for MMR#1, DTP#3, and DTP#4; the results were also significant in the hierarchical analyses. CONCLUSION: Children are vaccinated later in the practices of providers who are likely to refer uninsured children to a public vaccine clinic for vaccination, who do not receive free vaccine supplies, or who overinterpret contraindications.\",\n",
       " 'Since live rubeola vaccine became available in 1963, routine immunization of children at age 15 months has been the recommended strategy for eliminating measles in the United States. However, due to increasing measles outbreaks, especially among previously immunized populations, the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) recently recommended modifying the one-dose measles vaccination policy to a two-dose schedule, one at 15 months and one at age 5 or 6 years. To address the present college population, ACIP recommended vaccinating all college students who lack proof of immunity. We used the methods of decision analysis to examine the cost effectiveness of implementing such a program in a specific college population, namely, students at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). We developed a model to examine three possible vaccination strategies: \"wait,\" \"screen,\" and \"vaccinate all.\" Estimates of probabilities and cost were derived from several outbreaks at UCLA as well as statewide data. In the baseline case, the least expensive strategy is to wait until an outbreak occurs before implementing a vaccination program. The additional cost incurred by screening per measles case avoided is $122,871. However, using sensitivity analysis, we found that the overall cost of elective vaccination strategies is driven by the cost of the vaccine itself. If vaccine could be provided at a nominal cost to the university, a strategy of vaccinating all students without proof of immunity (by either history of two vaccinations or positive titer) would provide the high level of immunity needed to prevent outbreaks and still be most cost effective ($16,644 per measles case avoided).',\n",
       " \"A common situation in vaccine efficacy (VE) estimation is dealing with non-randomly mixing populations, which may subject vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals to a different infection pressure. These conditions may lead to a bias in VE estimates. The derivation of the statistical distribution of the number of vaccinated and infected out of a sample of n infections in a VE trial is essential to develop estimates and their properties. For randomly mixing populations, it has been shown recently that this follows a hypergeometric distribution for 'all/nothing' vaccines, whereas it is a non-central hypergeometric distribution for 'leaky' ones. Here it is shown that these distributions still hold under non-random mixing conditions, provided that mixing preferences and contact rates are independent of vaccination status. These conditions are met when vaccine and placebo are randomized.\",\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases are a major cause of illness and death among older adults. Vaccines can prevent infectious diseases, including against seasonal influenza, pneumococcal diseases, herpes zoster and COVID-19. However, the uptake of vaccination among older adults varies across settings and groups. Communication with healthcare workers can play an important role in older people's decisions to vaccinate. To support an informed decision about vaccination, healthcare workers should be able to identify the older person's knowledge gaps, needs and concerns. They should also be able to share and discuss information about the person's disease risk and disease severity; the vaccine's effectiveness and safety; and practical information about how the person can access vaccines. Therefore, healthcare workers need good communication skills and to actively keep up-to-date with the latest evidence. An understanding of their perceptions and experiences of this communication can help us train and support healthcare workers and design good communication strategies. OBJECTIVES: To explore healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of communicating with older adults about vaccination. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and Scopus on 21 March 2020. We also searched Epistemonikos for related reviews, searched grey literature sources, and carried out reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies. We searched for studies in any language. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included qualitative studies and mixed-methods studies with an identifiable qualitative component. We included studies that explored the perceptions and experiences of healthcare workers and other health system staff towards communication with adults over the age of 50 years or their informal caregivers about vaccination. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data using a data extraction form designed for this review. We assessed methodological limitations using a list of predefined criteria. We extracted and assessed data regarding study authors' motivations for carrying out their study. We used a thematic synthesis approach to analyse and synthesise the evidence. We used the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. We examined each review finding to identify factors that may influence intervention implementation and we developed implications for practice. MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 studies in our review. Most studies explored healthcare workers' views and experiences about vaccination of older adults more broadly but also mentioned communication issues specifically. All studies were from high-income countries. The studies focused on doctors, nurses, pharmacists and others working in hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and nursing homes. These healthcare workers discussed different types of vaccines, including influenza, pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccines. The review was carried out before COVID-19 vaccines were available. We downgraded our confidence in several of the findings from high confidence to moderate, low or very low confidence. One reason for this was that some findings were based on only small amounts of data. Another reason was that the findings were based on studies from only a few countries, making us unsure about the relevance of these findings to other settings. Healthcare workers reported that older adults asked about vaccination to different extents, ranging from not asking about vaccines at all, to great demand for information (high confidence finding). When the topic of vaccination was discussed, healthcare workers described a lack of information, and presence of misinformation, fears and concerns about vaccines among older adults (moderate confidence). The ways in which healthcare workers discussed vaccines with older adults appeared to be linked to what they saw as the aim of vaccination communication. Healthcare workers differed among themselves in their perceptions of this aim and about their own roles and the roles of older adults in vaccine decisions. Some healthcare workers thought it was important to provide information but emphasised the right and responsibility of older adults to decide for themselves. Others used information to persuade and convince older adults to vaccinate in order to increase 'compliance' and 'improve' vaccination rates, and in some cases to gain financial benefits. Other healthcare workers tailored their approach to what they believed the older adult needed or wanted (moderate confidence). Healthcare workers believed that older adults' decisions could be influenced by several factors, including the nature of the healthcare worker-patient relationship, the healthcare worker's status, and the extent to which healthcare workers led by example (low confidence). Our review also identified factors that are likely to influence how communication between healthcare workers and older adults take place. These included issues tied to healthcare workers' views and experiences regarding the diseases in question and the vaccines; as well as their views and experiences of the organisational and practical implementation of vaccine services. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is little research focusing specifically on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of communication with older adults about vaccination. The studies we identified suggest that healthcare workers differed among themselves in their perceptions about the aim of this communication and about the role of older adults in vaccine decisions. Based on these findings and the other findings in our review, we have developed a set of questions or prompts that may help health system planners or programme managers when planning or implementing strategies for vaccination communication between healthcare workers and older adults.\",\n",
       " 'Reports of adverse health effects to vaccinators after self-injection of fish vaccine motivated the present study which aimed at identifying risk factors and improving risk management. Information was collected through interviews with members of professional vaccinator teams, and with physicians who had treated injured vaccinators. In addition, a questionnaire was distributed among salmon farmers. Professional vaccinators reported from one to more than 50 stabs or self-injections during the vaccination season. Two cases of hospitalization due to anaphylactic reactions are described. Self-injections occurred exclusively on fingers and hands. The clinical picture is classified into four categories according to the type and severity of the reaction. The overall risk of self-injection leading to serious health effects was low, although the data do not allow a precise estimate. The collected information suggests that allergic hypersensitivity reactions occurred in two vaccinators, whereas increasing tolerance was reported from others. No information indicating infectious reactions was obtained, suggesting that non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs constitutes an appropriate therapy for self-injection events. The use of a safety bow attached to the syringe and improved training and awareness of personnel apparently have reduced the incidence of self-injection since this study was conducted. Health risks for vaccinators have further been reduced by equipping vaccinators with adrenaline and the improved knowledge of local doctors regarding recommended treatment.',\n",

Because no national data exist regarding vaccination coverage among adolescents, the impact of these recommendations is unknown. In October 1997, California enacted Assembly Bill 381 (AB381) that requires students entering the seventh grade on or after July 1, 1999, to have received three doses of hepatitis B vaccine and two doses of MMR. To assist in planning and implementing AB381, the San Diego County Health Department expanded its 1998 infant and adult vaccination survey to include fifth and sixth graders.

Another 150 farmers in the vicinity of Deventer who had vaccinated their calves in 1995 against lungworm were approached with the same questions. Our object was to investigate the consequences on worm control of the withdrawal of the lungworm vaccine from the market for reasons of possible BSE contamination of the vaccine. OF the returned questionnaires, 411 (43%) of the 'at random' group and 89 (59.3%) of the 'Deventer' group were valid. The most important data with regard to the farms of the 'at random' group (41) were: mean area 31.6 ha, mean number of calves 23, heifers 23 and milking cows 53. Sheep (mean 37) were present on 18.3% of the farms. With regard to management: 74.5% of the farmers turned the calves in their first year onto pasture, 25.5% kept them indoors. The average time on pasture was ca. 5 months. Rational grazing was practise on 81.4% of the farms, on 18.6% calves were set stocked. The first pasture of the calves was mown before turn-out on 72.9% of the farms. On 48.2% of these farms, calves were always moved to mown pastures. With regard to treatments: 33.8% of the farmers vaccinated their calves against lungworm in the years 1993, 1994 and 1995. Despite the withdrawal of the vaccine from the market in 1996, 7.2% of the farmers vaccinated their calves as recommended, with two doses, and 13.1% with a single dose. At turn-out, 41.5% of the farmers gave the calves a preventive anthelmintic treatment. Of these treatments, 66.9% were sustained of pulse release long acting device. During the grazing season, 36.6% of the farmers treated their calves. After housing 50.3% of the farmers gave a treatment. Signs of lungworm infection were noticed on 18.6% of the farms. Of the 'Deventer' group (89 farmers), 96.6% turned the calves out, Of these farmers, 86.0% had used the lungworm vaccine in 1995. In 1996, 52.7% of the farmers had vaccinated the calves:36.5% with a single dose and 16.2% with the double dose. Of the 35 farmers who did not vaccinate in 1996, 62.9% gave a preventive treatment at turn-out. Clinical signs of lungworm infection were not observed on the 12 farms which vaccinated the calves twice. On 11% of the farms which vaccinated once and on 14% of the farms which did not vaccinate, signs of lungworm infection were observed. It is concluded that more than 80% of Dutch dairy cattle farmers take appropriate measures to control gastrointestinal nematode and lungworm infections in calves in their first grazing season by grazing on aftermath, rotational grazing on mown pastures combined or not with preventive anthelmintic treatments. However, combinations of aftermath grazing and preventive treatment occurred on 30% of the farms. This may be overprotective and may prevent sufficient build up of immunity, causing worm problems at a later age. The withdrawal of the lungworm vaccine from the market did not cause a rise in lungworm problems. Some farmers did vaccinate, despite the withdrawal. The majority used other preventive treatment measures, mainly the application of long acting boli.\",\n",

While medical students come into contact with patients early in their medical education, sufficient vaccination is not routinely checked during their training. Hence, we wanted to assess the prevalence of medical students (fourth year) not sufficiently vaccinated against occupationally relevant infectious diseases (hepatitis A and B, measles, mumps, German measles, poliomyelitis) at the two medical schools in Munich. METHODS: One hundred and forty nine students of the medical school at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University and 89 students of the medical school at the Technical University completed a standardized questionnaire on demographic data, vaccination status and personal attitude towards vaccinations. RESULTS: Nine percent of the students at the Ludwig-Maximilans-University and one percent of the medical students at the Technical University reported not to have been vaccinated against hepatitis B. The relative frequency of students not vaccinated against hepatitis A was higher and did not differ between the medical schools (LMU: 35.9 %, TU: 40.5 %; 95 % Confidence Interval for the difference: -17.7-+ 8.5 %). The prevalence of vaccination especially against German measles among women was unsatisfactory. Individual vaccination status of the students seemed to be related to their personal attitude towards vaccinations. CONCLUSION: In order to increase the prevalence of hepatitis B vaccination among medical students they should be informed more intensively about the free of charge vaccination early during their education, e. g., before the beginning of their medical training.',\n",

This cross-sectional survey of persons vaccinated in nontraditional settings (NTS) by mass vaccinators was conducted to assess how effectively the mass vaccinators were able to implement these vaccination-timing guidelines. METHODS: In Minnesota, the Minnesota Visiting Nurse Agency (MVNA) is a major mass vaccinator in NTS. For the 2001-2002 vaccination season, MVNA developed several strategies designed to facilitate adherence to vaccination timing guidelines adopted by the Minnesota Department of Health. All persons vaccinated in the MVNA NTS clinics from October 2001 through December 2001 were surveyed in order to evaluate whether they were in a high-priority group and whether the timing of their vaccinations coincided with the timing promoted in the guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 46,174 of the 145,947 people vaccinated by the MVNA were vaccinated between October 14 and October 28, 2001, the time period designated for vaccination of high-priority groups. Of these, 41,143 (89%) responded to the priority group question and 27,211 (66%) indicated that they were in one of the targeted groups, including more than 19,000 Medicare recipients.

In no case severe vaccine-associated complications were observed. The frequency and manifestation of reactions in children with somatic pathology did nor essentially differ from those in relatively healthy children.

Sixty-two pig breeders returned the first questionnaire and 36 returned the second questionnaire. Before they started vaccination, 61% of the pig breeders sent samples to the laboratory of the Animal Health Service for investigation. At least one blood sample was positive for PRRS antibodies, but PRRS virus was not detected in any of the samples. Repeat breeding was the most important reason to vaccinate sows. On 54 farms (77%) sows were first vaccinated during the suckling period, on one farm (2%) sows were vaccinated during gestation, and on 7 farms (11%) all sows were vaccinated irrespective of their phase of reproduction. Repeat vaccinations were given during the suckling period on all farms. Mild side effects were reported on 16 farms (25%). Repeat breeding was the most important adverse reaction, followed by anoestrus. After 1 year, 58% of the pig breeders expressed satisfaction with vaccination. Twenty-eight pig breeders stopped vaccinating their sows in the first year, mainly because vaccination had no effect on the technical results. The effect of PRRS on the technical results of eight farms before and a year after vaccination was analysed. Although technical results were slightly better after vaccination, it was not clear whether this improvement was due to vaccination. From the results of this study it can be concluded that, without good diagnostic investigations, the routine vaccination of sows against PRRS is not economically viable in herds infected with PRRS virus.',\n",

The vaccinations were performed by nurses and most of the participants were vaccinated in special clinics (74.9%). Immobile participants were vaccinated either in their own homes (14.3%), in nursing homes (9.2%), or in hospitals (1.6%). One single case of hospitalisation of a chronically ill patient was registered, because of a weak influenza. No other side effects were registered. The total cost of all vaccinations was 4 million dkr. which is 115 dkr. (approximately 10 Pounds sterling) for each vaccination.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: During the influenza season of 1999-2000, private vaccination clinics in Denmark increasingly offered influenza vaccination in competition with general practitioners (GPs). The clinics arranged group vaccinations in the local community or at workplaces at prices below the standard price. The aim of this study was to assess the actual proportion of people vaccinated, both in the elderly and in the younger population, and to elucidate the effect of marketing by the private vaccination clinics. MATERIAL AND METHOD: In February 2000, a questionnaire about influenza vaccination and general health was posted to 2,144 persons aged 65 or older and 1,717 aged 18-64 years randomly drawn from the Home Office Central Person Register. The questionnaire was completed by 70% in the older group and 66% in the younger group. RESULTS: In Denmark, 47% of the older group and 8% of the younger group were vaccinated against influenza. In the municipality of Copenhagen the acceptance rate was 66% in the older group, compared to 46% in the rest of the country. General practitioners vaccinated 69% of the older group and 66% of the younger group, 24% were vaccinated at a vaccination clinic, and 7% were vaccinated elsewhere. Half the 18-64 year-olds were vaccinated by their own GP, 33% at their workplace, 11% at a vaccination clinic, and 6% elsewhere. DISCUSSION: Based on this study, it is recommended that more effort is made to vaccinate young people in treatment for a chronic illness and the elderly against influenza. Influenza vaccination campaigns aimed at defined target groups could easily be done by general practitioners without establishing a new ad hoc organisation.',\n",

       " 'The effect, hazards and risk of vaccinations may be calculated by means of special formulas which determine the value for N, Q and D. The formula for N considers the question whether a vaccination is effective, necessary and valuable and may be recommended on epidemiological grounds. Q considers the individual risk (i. e. relation between total risk of unvaccinated and vaccinated persons) and D the yearly difference in risks between unvaccinated and vaccinated members of a community. If p stands for protection rate of a vaccination, t = time for which the vaccination effect is lasting, R = complications of disease under study in a community in which vaccinations against this disease are not in use and r = comparable complications of vaccination, the following formulas are applicable: (see article) A vaccination may be recommended if N and Q greater than 1 and the value for D is positiv. Application of these formulas to special vaccinations lead to the following conclusions: In case of BCG, measles and poliomyelitis (oral vaccination) the above mentioned values exceed at least 10(1)-10(2) (N), 4-5 (Q) or are highly positiv (D). These vaccinations-if performed correctly-are considered valuable and highly recommendable. Vaccination against pertussis is not recommendable beyond the second year of life. According to the present epidemiologic situation in Austria this vaccination is still rectified in children under 2 years. However, values for N, Q and D are near border-line and should be yearly evaluated. Smallpox vaccination in Europe is still recommendable. Similarly, continuous reevaluations are necessary due to low values of N, Q and D. On the other hand, vaccination against tetanus is available and vaccination against influenza may be recommended.',\n",

       " 'A large number of infectious diseases in man and animals may be prevented by vaccination today, but (satisfactory) vaccines are not yet currently available for all forms of infection. Various reasons may be given to account for this fact, such as slight effectiveness of the experimental vaccines so far developed, limitations of large-scale production, storage and distribution of vaccines, etcetera. Recent developments in the fields of molecular biology, virology, bacteriology and immunology offer new opportunities for the development and improvement of vaccines. Two types of vaccine are distinguished, viz. dead and live vaccines. Live vaccines usually produce a stronger and longer-lasting immunity than dead vaccines, and the latter require the assistance of compounds which promote immunity, so-called adjuvants. However, the adjuvants used today tend to give rise to untoward side-effects, or are only moderately effective. The use of new and safer substances as substitutions for adjuvants which are currently administered may help to produce improved vaccines. A number of aspects of adjuvants, such as their possibilities and limitations, the variety of compounds having an adjuvant effect and possible mechanisms of action will be discussed in the present paper.',\n",
       " 'In april 1986 a questionnaire was submitted to the mothers of a randomized sample of children born in 1984 in a city of the hinterland of Milan. The aim of the investigation was to get information on the level of knowledge of the population on pertussis and measles diseases and on pertussis and measles vaccinations that are optional in our country. The mothers were also asked to specify the reasons of not having vaccinated their children. Aut of 146 questionnaires distributed, 137 (93%) were filled. According to the mother\\'s recall, 22 (16%) children had been vaccinated against pertussis and 36 (26%) against measles. On the whole, the results indicate that the lack of pertussis and measles vaccinations was mainly due to ignorance about the diseases and about the vaccines. Indeed, the reasons for the lack of vaccination most frequently given by the mothers were: \" belief that a child msut get these diseases\" (23% of the answers for pertussis and 36% for measles), \" ignorance of the availability of vaccines \" (32% for anti-pertussis and 16% for anti-measles vaccination); \"poor knowledge on the facilities in which to get child vaccinated\" (23% for anti-pertussis and 16% for anti-measles vaccination). Moreover, on the total of the 137 interviewed mothers only 37% and 56%, respectively, knew that natural pertussis and natural measles may be accompanied or followed by complications. The frequency of the various answers was rather homogeneous regardless of the mother\\'s schooling and of mother being a house-wife or working outside the home. It is therefore concluded that to obtain a satisfactory compliance to measles and pertussis vaccinations, it is necessary to educate parents and to improve their knowledge of the diseases and of the benefits of the vaccines.',\n",

The World Health Organization has recommended RV vaccines' use in national immunization programs since 2009. However, access to vaccines remain limited, particularly for most low- and middle-income countries where the burden of the disease is high. The Philippines is a lower-middle income country in Asia where RV vaccination remains limited. Recent studies in the Philippines indicate an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 60% against RV hospitalization, and a 50-60% reduction of all cause diarrhea among children aged under 5 within the population. Furthermore, we estimate that 225 rotavirus cases can be prevented per 1000 children vaccinated against RV. This information will be crucial as policymakers decide on expanding RV vaccination nationwide.\",\n",

       " \"In the recent past (1997) the Flemish authorities have turned the vaccination policy into one of the top priorities of their health policy. Following the WHO-guidelines they have brought forward a health objective anticipating a significant increase of the vaccination rate for a number of infectious diseases by 2002. Recent research shows that attention should be paid especially to measles, mumps and rubella (83% vaccination rate at 18-24 months), hepatitis B (74-69%) and type b haemophilus influenzae (78%). The vaccination rate in Flanders for polio, diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough is good or adequate at the age of 18-24 months. In 2000, the Flemish authorities reserve about BEF 80 million for the purchase of basic vaccines distributed for free through their health inspections, just like in the previous years. In order to realise this objective, all medical bodies carrying responsibility in this field are appealed to. Moreover, the local regional consultative bodies, financially supported by the Flemish Community, may be expected to play a stimulating role in, so far, four out of the five Flemish provinces. A strong management from a central Flemish vaccination umbrella organisation is considered to be indispensable in order to have the vaccinating bodies deliberate, have them build a consensus and motivate them. This should result in clear and generally accepted vaccination schedules and a well-informed and sensitised population. A project in view of a rapid and efficient registration of vaccination data in a central Flemish vaccination database, accessible for vaccinating doctors is now running with 'Child and Family' and can subsequently be extended to the entire target group.\",\n",
       " \"INTRODUCTION: Concomitant (same-day) delivery of two or more vaccines to adolescents is effective, safe, and efficient. Increasing concomitant vaccination could improve coverage for recommended adolescent vaccines, but little is known about who receives vaccines concomitantly. METHODS: Data came from healthcare provider-verified records on 70,144 adolescents (aged 13-17 years) in the 2008-2012 versions of the National Immunization Survey-Teen who had received at least one dose of tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) booster; meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY); or human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. Separately for each vaccine, multivariable logistic regression identified adolescent and household correlates of concomitant versus single vaccination, stratified by adolescent sex. Vaccination took place in 2007-2012, data collection in 2008-2012, and data analysis in 2015. RESULTS: Among vaccinated adolescents, 51%-65% of girls and 25%-53% of boys received two vaccines concomitantly. Concomitant uptake of each vaccine increased over survey years (e.g., 2012 vs 2008: girls' Tdap booster, OR=1.88, 95% CI=1.56, 2.26; boys' Tdap booster, OR=2.62, 95% CI=2.16, 3.16), with the exception of HPV vaccination among boys. Additionally, concomitant vaccination was less common as adolescents got older and in the Northeast (all p<0.05). For MenACWY and HPV vaccine, concomitant uptake was less common for girls whose mothers had higher versus lower education and for boys who lived in metropolitan versus non-metropolitan areas (all p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Missed opportunities for concomitant adolescent vaccination persist, particularly for HPV vaccine. Future interventions targeting groups with low rates of concomitant vaccination could improve population-level coverage with recommended vaccines.\",\n",
       " 'We conducted a study to analyse the efficiency of introducing vaccination against hepatitis A to the schedule for troops in the British Army. The study design included a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of cost per case avoided comparing active and passive immunization and a cost-benefit analysis (CBA). The study population comprised all British Army personnel as well as those soldiers assumed to be deployed to high-risk areas a variable number of times in 5 years. The average cost of one case of hepatitis A avoided by vaccination was calculated and compared with the average cost of achieving the same outcome by passive immunization. In a 5-year four-exposure scenario at a low incidence and using a 3% discount rate, avoiding one case of hepatitis A by vaccination would cost 52,865 pounds, against 97,305 pounds by passive immunization. The equivalent cost-benefit ratios are 13.4 for gammaglobulin and 7.2 for vaccine. For fewer exposures the break-even point for vaccine is two exposures in 4 years. Although our estimates are sensitive to direct costs and relatively sensitive to the estimated incidence, vaccinating troops against hepatitis A appears to be a more efficient procedure than passive immunization, especially as a long-term investment in troops likely to effect several operational deployments. Given the difficulty of forecasting which troops would deploy, the best-buy strategy may be vaccination of troops most likely to deploy repeatedly.',\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: In the current COVID-19 pandemic, the world has reached an important milestone where vaccinations are discovered and are proven to be effective against SARS-COV-2 infections. Though vaccines against COVID-19 are now available, around the globe there is some hesitancy in getting the vaccine. This hesitancy to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is a complex phenomenon with various factors playing a role. This study aims at understanding the perception and expectations of the people about COVID-19 vaccine and the factors influencing the vaccine acceptance. This information is crucial to challenge vaccine hesitancy and to win the combat against the COVID-19 Pandemic through voluntary vaccine efforts. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey among the residents of the UAE to understand the expectations and perception on vaccination against COVID-19. The survey was conducted online, and the survey design included participant samples to be representative of UAE's demographics. The results of the survey were analysed with various demographical variables of interest. RESULTS: The survey showed that people were more likely to get vaccinated when vaccines are (i) endorsed by trusted government health authorities, (ii) recommended by physicians and family doctors, and (iii) the merits are effectively communicated through government websites and trusted news channels. Availability of vaccines at multiple sites and providing vaccines free of charges are likely to improve the rate of vaccination. The perceptions, expectations and the motivational factors needed for people to get vaccinated differed with age, gender, marital status, income level, and employment status. CONCLUSION: To attain herd immunity against COVID-19, a large proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated and to achieve this the vaccination campaigns should target on specific expectations and motivational factors pertaining to each target group to successfully overcome the challenge of vaccine hesitancy.\",\n",
       " 'Animal models are essential for acquiring safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data to support the development of novel vaccines. However, extrapolating such results to designing human trials is challenging due to species-specific differences in responses to antigens, adjuvants and pathogens. As well, most early vaccine work is conducted with in-bred mouse strains which may fail to uncover issues that could arise later in out-bred populations. Unlike drugs designed to be delivered systemically, vaccines work within a somewhat localized space, so allometric dose scaling to account for body size differences is not necessarily relevant. Comparison of immune responses and correlates of protection with a given antigen show widely variable results between animals and humans, even where protective immunity against challenge with the same pathogen can be studied. For adjuvants, it is possible to compare enhancement of immunogenicity compared to a non-adjuvant control vaccine. While some novel adjuvants provide similar levels of enhancement between species, others do not. It is also important to recognize the inter-relationship between antigens and adjuvants, since one can compensate for the other, masking particular effects. Despite all the limitations, animal immunogenicity and efficacy studies form an important part of pre-clinical development for novel vaccines, but considerable prudence is required when using and extrapolating results.',\n",
       " 'In contrast to many regions of the world where rabies is endemic in terrestrial wildlife species, wildlife rabies has been controlled in Israel by oral rabies vaccination programs, but canine rabies is re-emerging in the northern area of the Golan Heights. From 2009 to 2014 there were 208 animal rabies cases in Israel; 96 (46%) were considered introduced primary cases in dogs, triggering 112 secondary cases. One third (37/112) of the secondary cases were in cattle. Rabies vaccination is voluntary for cattle in Israel, except those on public exhibit. Rabies vaccination schedules for cattle vary based on farm practices and perception of risk. In this study 59 cattle from a dairy farm which routinely vaccinates against rabies were assigned into six groups according to age and vaccination histories. Four groups contained adult cows which had received one previous rabies vaccination, one group of adults had received two previous vaccinations, and one group was unvaccinated calves. Serum samples were collected and the cows were vaccinated with a commercial rabies vaccine. Sera were again collected 39 days later and the calf group re-vaccinated and re-sampled 18 days later. Sera were analyzed for the presence of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies using the rapid immunofluorescent antibody test. Cattle with antibody titres ≥ 0.5 IU/ml were considered to be protected against rabies. Twenty-six of 27 adult cattle (96%) vaccinated once at less than five months old did not have protective titres. Sixty percent (6/10) cattle vaccinated once at around six months of age did have adequate titres. Cattle previously vaccinated twice (n=10; 100%) with an 18 month interval between inoculations, had protective titres and protective antibody titres following booster vaccination (n=51; 100%). The anamnestic response of cattle to a killed rabies vaccine was not affected by the time interval between vaccinations, which ranged from 12 to 36 months. These results suggest that calves from vaccinated cows should not be vaccinated before six months old to avoid maternal antibody interference. Whilst most cattle older than six months old will be protected after a single inoculation, a second inoculation ensures a higher antibody levels for improved protection. Cattle receiving an effective priming dose responded well to a booster up to 36 months later. Such results demonstrate the effectiveness of rabies vaccination in cattle and the added value of a second dose to ensure a prolonged immune response against rabies.',\n",
       " 'The objective of this work was to assess the opinions of public health professionals (PHPs) about routinely recommended and new vaccines, and to evaluate the feasibility of using a modified Basic Priority Rating System (BPRS) approach to prioritize new immunization programs. One hundred and thirty six PHPs were invited to participate in the survey and 101 responded. Ninty-eight percent of respondents agreed that \"recommended vaccines are very useful\" (mean score=9.5 out of 10). Between 47% and 100% of respondents agreed with statements about usefulness, safety, effectiveness and acceptability of seven new vaccines (mean scores 5.7-9.7). The highest BPRS scores were observed for MMRV (7.3), DTaP-IPV-HBV-Hib (7.0), and conjugate ACYW-135 (5.4), followed by HPV (4.8), HAV (4.4), rotavirus (1.6) and zoster vaccine (1.5%). The results demonstrate that PHPs perceive presently recommended vaccines as very useful tools in infection prevention. On the other hand, the perceived usefulness, safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of new vaccines are heterogeneous. This heterogeneity is indicative of the complexity of decision-making around implementation of new immunization programs and the need for tools facilitating program prioritization. The modified BPRS approach using survey responses to five statements on program usefulness, vaccine safety, effectiveness, and acceptance by vaccinators and the population is a simple, feasible and inexpensive method of prioritizing new immunization programs. The method we propose is flexible in choosing target groups and allows a large number of professionals to be involved in the decision-making process about new immunization programs.',\n",

       " 'Upper arm injury related to vaccine administration (UAIRVA) is an infrequent but increasingly recognised complication of deltoid muscle vaccination. Vaccine administration reported injury to the subdeltoid/subacromial bursa, anterior branch of the axillary nerve and the radial nerve presumably reflects the lack of awareness of the anatomical position of these structures in and near this muscle and the multiplicity of methods for the selection of the injection site in the muscle. An evidence based protocol for safe vaccine administration into the deltoid muscle is presented. This was developed using anthropometric measurements of the surface anatomical landmarks in adults who regularly receive intramuscular injection of vaccines into the deltoid muscle (adults ≥ 65 years old) and mapping the position of structures potentially injured by injection observed in ultrasonographic and cadaveric studies. The mid point of the muscle (midway between the acromion and the deltoid tuberosity) with the arm abducted to 60° is a safe site for injection. The protocol for vaccine administration in this way involves the vaccinee placing the hand on the ipsilateral hip with the vaccinator then placing their index finger on the acromion and their thumb on the deltoid tuberosity and administering the vaccine at midpoint between these anatomical landmarks.',\n",
       " 'In partnership with industry, WHO has developed a number of strategies to facilitate access to vaccines recommended for use in national immunization programs. These strategies have been necessitated by the increasing fragility of vaccine supply for developing markets. The potential global spread of epidemic disease has made it imperative to expand these efforts. A new concept is proposed, that of essential vaccines, defined as \"vaccines of public health importance that should be accessible to all people at risk\". Essential vaccines will include emergency response vaccines that have become important due to resurgent outbreaks, threatening global pandemics, and situations where a global emergency immunization response may be needed. While some of the approaches already developed will be applicable to emergency response vaccines, other novel approaches requiring public sector intervention will be necessary. Procurement, financing and allocation of these emergency response vaccines, if left to governments or private individuals based on ability to pay, will threaten equitable access. The challenge will be to ensure development of and equitable access to these vaccines while not threatening the already fragile supply of other essential vaccines.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Vaccination Program for US-bound Refugees (VPR) currently provides one or two doses of some age-specific Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)-recommended vaccines to US-bound refugees prior to departure. METHODS: We quantified and compared the full vaccination costs for refugees using two scenarios: (1) the baseline of no VPR and (2) the current situation with VPR. Under the first scenario, refugees would be fully vaccinated after arrival in the United States. For the second scenario, refugees would receive one or two doses of selected vaccines before departure and complete the recommended vaccination schedule after arrival in the United States. We evaluated costs for the full vaccination schedule and for the subset of vaccines provided by VPR by four age-stratified groups; all costs were reported in 2015 US dollars. We performed one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and break-even analyses to evaluate the robustness of results. RESULTS: Vaccination costs with the VPR scenario were lower than costs of the scenario without the VPR for refugees in all examined age groups. Net cost savings per person associated with the VPR were ranged from $225.93 with estimated Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA) or Medicaid payments for domestic costs to $498.42 with estimated private sector payments. Limiting the analyses to only the vaccines included in VPR, the average costs per person were 56% less for the VPR scenario with RMA/Medicaid payments. Net cost savings with the VPR scenario were sensitive to inputs for vaccination costs, domestic vaccine coverage rates, and revaccination rates, but the VPR scenario was cost savings across a range of plausible parameter estimates. CONCLUSIONS: VPR is a cost-saving program that would also reduce the risk of refugees arriving while infected with a vaccine preventable disease.',\n",

After infection one sentinel pig was added to the vaccinated and infected pigs of each group. A single vaccination did not induce protective immunity against a CSFV challenge. Double vaccination at a four-week interval protected piglets from clinical infection, and neither viraemia and leukopenia nor virus excretion were detected if infected 14 d p.v2. Two vaccinations at a two-week interval followed by a challenge 7 d p.v2. led to a short viraemia on day 5 p.i. but without excretion of CSFV. Though all other vaccination schedules induced a reduction in virus shedding and a decrease in CSFV replication, in all these cases in-contact controls became infected. The results of transmission of CSFV are discussed in relation to a potential use of subunit marker vaccines in CSF control.',\n",

       " \"Knowledge among the rural parents about the vaccinations and vaccination coverage of children in the first year of life in Papua New Guinea - analysis of data provided by Christian Health Services. BACKGROUND: This analysis aimed to assess rural parents' knowledge about the diseases prevented by vaccinations and establish vaccination coverage in PNG. METHODS: Knowledge of vaccinations was checked through a standard questionnaire (five closed questions). We analyzed data on vaccination coverage from 2016 to 2018 from all Catholic health facilities. Analyzed vaccinations were the pentavalent vaccine (DTaP-HiB-HepB) and measles vaccine given in the first year of life. Coverage was calculated based on the number of vaccines used compared to the number of eligible children. Analyzed vaccinations were the pentavalent vaccine (DTaP-HiB-HepB) and measles vaccine given in the first year of life. RESULTS: Fifty-six parents, including 52 mothers and four fathers, participated in the interview. Many parents (46%) understood that the vaccine prevents diseases. During the analyzed period, 25,502 doses of measles vaccine were given, 31,428 children were vaccinated with the pentavalent vaccine. In 2016, the measles vaccine coverage rate was 26.6 and 33.4% for the pentavalent vaccine. In 2017, measles and pentavalent vaccines' coverage rate was 12.5 and 16.6%, respectively. There were significant differences in immunization coverage between provinces. A decreasing trend in the number of administered vaccinations was observed. CONCLUSION: The results of this analysis demonstrate that in PNG, the majority of children are not fully immunized. There are significant differences in the vaccination coverage between provinces. As protection from diseases is low, there is a very high risk of an outbreak of the vaccine-preventable disease in the community. Delivery of vaccinations in PNG encounters many barriers, from access to healthcare services to natural disasters and inter-tribial conflicts.\",\n",
       " 'Measles vaccination is a cost-effective way to prevent infection and reduce mortality and morbidity. However, in countries with fragile routine immunization infrastructure, coverage rates are still low and supplementary immunization campaigns (SIAs) are used to reach previously unvaccinated children. During campaigns, vaccine is generally administered to every child, regardless of their vaccination status and as a result, there is the possibility that a child that is already immune to measles (i.e. who has had 2+\\u202fvaccinations) would receive an unnecessary dose, resulting in excess cost. Selective vaccination has been proposed as one solution to this; children who were able to provide documentation of previous vaccination would not be vaccinated repeatedly. While this would result in reduced vaccine and supply cost, it would also require additional staff time and increased social mobilization investment, potentially outweighing the benefits. We utilize Monte Carlo simulation to assess under what conditions a selective vaccination policy would indeed result in net savings. We demonstrate that cost savings are possible in contexts with a high joint probability of an individual child having both 2+\\u202fprevious measles doses and also an available record. We also find that the magnitude of net cost savings is highly dependent on whether a country is using measles-only or measles-rubella vaccine and on the required skill set of the individual who would review the previous vaccination records.',\n",

In light of the recent discussion on the potential abrogation in other regions, we explored the opinion of family pediatricians who play a crucial role in promoting immunization programmes in Italy. In November 2009, we interviewed by phone the family pediatricians working in Puglia region using a standardised, ad hoc and piloted questionnaire. Of the 596 contacted, 502 (84.2%) completed the questionnaire (54% female, median age = 52 y). Among the respondents, 72 (14.3%) would agree on the hypothesis of abrogation. This judgment was associated with having a good opinion on the level of awareness of the importance of vaccinations in the general public (OR = 6.6; 95% CI: 3.6-12.1) and having the perception of adequate organization of Vaccination Services in supporting the abrogation (OR = 3.6; 95% CI: 1.7-5.9). Family pediatricians appeared really sceptical about the abrogation of compulsory vaccination that could be hypothesized only increasing public awareness, communication skills and capability of Vaccination Services personnel in offering vaccinations.',\n",
       " 'Vaccine hesitancy refers to delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccine services. Despite the efforts of United States healthcare providers to vaccinate the bulk of its population, vaccine hesitancy is still a severe challenge that has led to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases to over 100,000 people during early August 2021. To our knowledge, there are limited nationwide studies that examined the spatial distribution of vaccination rates, mainly based on the social vulnerability index (SVI). In this study, we compiled a database of the percentage of fully vaccinated people at the county scale across the continental United States as of 29 July 2021, along with SVI data as potential significant covariates. We further employed multiscale geographically weighted regression to model spatial nonstationarity of vaccination rates. Our findings indicated that the model could explain over 79% of the variance of vaccination rate based on Per capita income and Minority (%) (with positive impacts), and Age 17 and younger (%), Mobile homes (%), and Uninsured people (%) (with negative effects). However, the impact of each covariate varied for different counties due to using separate optimal bandwidths. This timely study can serve as a geospatial reference to support public health decision-makers in forming region-specific policies in monitoring vaccination programs from a geographic perspective.',\n",

       " 'Years ago, intramuscular influenza vaccines were the only option for those who wanted to arm themselves against the flu. Today there are alternatives, including intradermal injections and intranasal sprays. In order to select the right influenza vaccine for their patients, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals must have a basic understanding of the immune system. Influenza vaccines elicit different levels of immune response involving innate and adaptive immunity, which are critical to fighting infection. For the 2013-2014 flu season, there were 13 different formulations of influenza vaccines on the market with vast differences in indications, contraindications, and effectiveness. The CDC does not recommend one vaccine over another, but recommends that all patients be vaccinated against the flu. Preventing the spread of influenza is no simple task; however, the most recent evidence on influenza vaccines and sufficient knowledge of the immune system will allow pharmacists and other healthcare providers to better advocate for vaccines, determine which are most appropriate, and ensure their proper administration.',\n",
       " 'Although a number of routine and catch-up vaccinations are currently recommended for adolescents, coverage rates of these vaccines are currently suboptimal. Routine recommended immunizations for this cohort include vaccines for influenza, human papillomavirus, and meningococcal disease, as well as a booster for tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis. Adolescence is also a critical period for administration of catch-up vaccines for those not fully immunized during childhood. Adolescents who do not seek appropriate preventive healthcare are at risk for significant morbidity and possible mortality. Increasing adolescent adherence to recommended vaccine schedules presents a challenge and opportunity for pediatricians and public health advocates. This article outlines barriers to vaccine compliance among adolescents and discusses strategies to increase vaccine uptake.',\n",
       " \"The article focuses on the fact that 2020 has become a new point in the history of mankind, irrevocably changing the ways of life accepted in society and forcing the entire population of the earth to live in a new way. If a person's health is threatened and / or worried about the thought of a terminal illness, it is difficult to focus on something else. Over the past year, many have experienced this reality for the first time. Effective January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus outbreak a health emergency, causing international concern. The fact that some countries (New Zealand, Australia and South Korea) quickly contained the spread of the virus, but faced new, imported cases, leads to the conclusion that the victory over COVID-19 is possible only worldwide. And if in 2020 masks and social distancing were the methods of fighting the virus, then the main method of 2021 will be the vaccination of the inhabitants of the earth. However, here, too, the key factor is the scale of vaccination, which is one of the main factors in the effectiveness of the fight against any large-scale disease. Here, every person faces a moral and legal question: participation in vaccination is the right of every person as a bearer of human dignity, which implies the impossibility of taking any action on a person without his consent, or the duty of a member of society, which implies the need for vaccination as the question of the survival of the human race as a whole. The article draws attention to the refusal to vaccinate against measles in Ukraine and the consequences of such a choice. The reason for the lack of measles vaccination at the required epidemiological level in Ukraine is not the lack of the necessary vaccines, but the conscious choice of a negative model of behavior by the citizens of the country. The refusal to vaccinate children may be due to a psychological factor caused by the death of a student who was vaccinated against measles on the eve of death. At the same time, the media thirteen years after the event, conducting numerous medical examinations, provides fundamentally contradictory information about the causal relationship between the vaccination of a student against measles and his death. Based on the analysis, it was concluded that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection and severe outcomes caused by viruses. Despite this vaccination coverage against viral infections, seasonal influenza in many countries around the world remains low. Even if a vaccine is available to the citizens of a particular country, but educational programs are not carried out on the need and importance of vaccination, the potential for increasing vaccination rates against viruses will continually diminish. The most common explanation for the current upsurge in vaccine uncertainty is that the Internet enables vaccine deniers to reach out to a wide audience by publicizing their beliefs. Some activists only criticize some vaccines. Such a selective stance may indicate a communication strategy used to promote a particular vaccine. Attention should also be paid to the refusal to vaccinate due to the lack of acceptance by the human mind of traditional medicine, not belief in its effectiveness, the use of alternative, alternative medicine in the treatment of diseases. The reasons for not trusting the vaccination process are highlighted. These include: lack of trust in vaccine manufacturers who are economically motivated to make a profit; not trusting medical institutions that provide vaccinations and the conditions in which vaccines are stored; lack of confidence in government agencies involved in the procurement of vaccines, the possibility of corruption in case of abuse of their powers; fear of disease and side effects due to vaccination; distortion by the media of objective data on vaccination.\",\n",
       " \"The field of vaccines and vaccinology has seen remarkable progress during the past 20 years. Many vaccines, however, still need to be improved, either because the protection they provide is relatively short-lived and would greatly benefit from the development of booster formulations (as is the case for tuberculosis), or because they only cover part of the many serotypes of the pathogen that causes the disease (rotaviruses, papillomaviruses, or Streptococcus pneumoniae). In addition, still many diseases lack a proper preventive vaccine, such as AIDS, hepatitis C, malaria, viral pneumonias, croup and bronchiolitis, dengue fever, leishmaniasis, Staphylococcus aureus, groups A and B Streptococcus, Shigellas and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, to only name a few. These are the current targets of vaccines under development, a great many of which will hopefully reach the market within the coming 10 years. The development of preventive vaccines against chronic diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis C will probably require more time, due to basic science complexities to be overcome first. It is likely that the future will also see an emphasis on therapeutic vaccines targeted against noninfectious diseases such as cancers (lung, skin, prostate, etc) and metabolic or neurologic diseases (atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease). This review will focus on examples of preventive vaccines under development that target infectious diseases with a heavy global burden on public health.\",\n",
       " 'Adjuvants are used to improve the immune response to vaccines. Formulation with adjuvants can result in an earlier onset of immunity, an overall stronger immune response, a specific type of immunity, or a longer duration of immunity to the vaccine. Adjuvants were discovered empirically, and for decades, have been used in both humans and animals without understanding the mechanisms of action. With an improved understanding of the immune system, and in particular the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity, we are now getting better insight into the function of adjuvants. As a result, new adjuvants are being developed that are safe and highly effective for common use in humans and animals, as well as for use in high risk populations such as immunocompromised animals, neonates or very old animals. Furthermore, adjuvants can help to reduce the amount of antigen needed in the vaccine, increase the stability of the vaccine and enable alternatiye administration routes such as needle-free delivery of the vaccine. Here, I will provide an over view of the existing adjuvant technologies for veterinary vaccines and provide an outlook into some of the new technologies in preclinical and clinical development.',\n",
       " \"The influenza vaccine was underused in Switzerland in 1996, as less than half of people at risk for the disease were vaccinated. We performed this study in 1997 to determine (1) the immunisation rate in the patients admitted to the internal medicine ward of the Cantonal Hospital, Fribourg and in those seen by family physicians, (2) the reasons underlying the decision of the physician to vaccinate their patients or not, (3) the physicians' opinion of the vaccination. The study was retrospective and included 383 patients hospitalised in the medicine ward between October 15 and November 25, 1997. 249 of them (65%) had an indication for vaccination against influenza according to the recommendations of the Federal Office of Public Health. Only 20 patients (8%) were vaccinated during their hospital stay. 86 family physicians (83%) answered the questionnaire concerning 141 patients (57%) whom they examined after their hospital discharge. Of these patients, 77 (55%) were vaccinated by the family physician. The main reason for not vaccinating the patients was the patient's refusal (33%). The effectiveness of the vaccine was considered to be very good (effectiveness > 80%) by 40% of the family physicians and good (effectiveness 60-80%) by 50%. The local and systemic side effects were reported to be rare (incidence < 5%) by 55% and 71% of family physicians respectively. The cost and the route of administration were not felt to have any effect on acceptance of the vaccine. In decreasing importance the family physicians considered the recommendations of the Federal Office of Public Health useful for (1) chronic pulmonary disease, (2) immunosuppression, (3) chronic cardiac disease, (4) chronic renal insufficiency and residency in homes or institutions, (5) diabetes, (6) age over 64, (7) health care workers. In conclusion, the influenza immunisation rate in Fribourg was very low at the hospital but was higher than the Swiss figures for the family physicians. Patient's refusal was the main reason for non-vaccination. The family physicians have a favourable opinion of the effectiveness and tolerance of the influenza vaccine.\",\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVES: The effectiveness of vaccines is known to be altered by a range of psychological factors. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effects of psychological interventions on the ability of vaccines to protect against disease, as measured by antibody responses. METHODS: Electronic databases (EMBASE, Medline, PsychINFO, CINAHL) were searched from their inception to 6th February 2018. RESULTS: The search yielded 9 eligible trials conducted with 1603 participants and four broad categories of intervention: meditation/mindfulness (n\\u202f=\\u202f3), massage (n\\u202f=\\u202f3), expressive writing (n\\u202f=\\u202f2) and cognitive behavioural stress management (n\\u202f=\\u202f1). Some evidence of benefit on the antibody response to vaccination was observed in 6/9 of all trials and in 4/7 of randomised controlled trials. However, effects on antibody levels were often mixed, with only 3 of 6 trials showing benefit demonstrating an improvement in all antibody outcomes and at all time points assessed. Trials demonstrating benefit also provided direct or indirect evidence of adequate adherence with the intervention; and in 50% of these trials, there was also evidence that the intervention was effective in changing the mediating psychological constructs targeted by the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This literature is characterised by considerable heterogeneity in terms of intervention type, vaccine type, age of participants and the temporal relationship between vaccination and intervention. We conclude that there is early evidence to suggest that psychological interventions may enhance the antibody response to vaccination. However, the effects are inconsistent, with the greatest likelihood of benefit seen in trials evidencing adequate adherence with the intervention. Future work would benefit from rigorous intervention development that focuses on achieving adequate adherence and large well-controlled randomised trials with a focus on an agreed set of outcomes.',\n",
       " \"INTRODUCTION: This paper describes the first ever analysis of health data to report influenza vaccine uptake and the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing general practice presentations for influenza-like illness (ILI) in the UK Armed Forces (UK AF). This was undertaken during the 2017-2018 influenza season. METHODS: Clinical Read codes for ILI and influenza vaccinations were used to generate reports for the period from September 2017 to April 2018. Using a methodology adapted from Public Health England's (PHE) in hours syndromic surveillance, the ILI rate for the UK AF was calculated. Subsequent analysis explored vaccination uptake in target groups and compared the relative risk (RR) of ILI in vaccinated versus unvaccinated Service Personnel (SP). RESULTS: 4234 SPs had a record of ILI between September 2017 and April 2018, with a peak rate of 216 cases per 100 000 PAR. The absolute risk reduction for reporting ILI in vaccinated versus unvaccinated SP was 0.4% (p=0.0031), and the RR was statistically significant at 15% (95% CI 5% to 23 %) lower than in the non-vaccinated PAR. The number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one presentation of ILI was 241 (95% CI 145 to 714). The 8153 vaccinations recorded for the untrained strength equate to approximately 38% of overall training throughput and 65% of all Army SP recorded as being in phase 1 training at some point during this period. CONCLUSIONS: The relative risk reduction (RRR) for vaccinated personnel was modest and lower than reported elsewhere, but closely compares with ILI rates included in a 2018 Cochrane review. The small RRR and large NNV do not support widening the population of UK AF eligible to receive influenza vaccine. Regimental Medical Officers (RMOs) seeking advice on whether to vaccinate other groups of SP should be aware that this approach offers questionable clinical benefit. The ILI surveillance methodology used in this work could be adapted for syndromic surveillance of other infectious diseases.\",\n",

The first group involves well established and commonly used vaccines such as BCG and DPT vaccines. The second group includes newer vaccines or vaccines that are under development, for instance vaccines against meningococci, pneumococci, H. influenzae and enteropathogenic E. coli. The third group covers vaccines whose realisation at present appears to be difficult or hardly feasible, for instance vaccines against enterotoxins of enteropathogenic organisms, against lues, gonorrhea or, example, against organisms of hospital infections.',\n",

       " \"Background: This paper examines the association between access to a health facility and the continuum of child vaccination behaviors, which include: uptake of each vaccine, dropout, and timing of vaccine take-up in Nigeria.Methods: The health facility census data (2014) were merged into the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (2013) to calculate the distance between respondents' locations and the nearest health facility, and to evaluate its impact on the series of vaccination behaviors, using logistic and OLS regression.Results: Among 21,369 children aged 12 to 59 months old, 78.2% of them were ever vaccinated. An additional distance of 1 km to the nearest clinic reduces the likelihood that one receives a vaccine by about 5% [OR: 0.952, 95% CI = 0.935-0.969]. Distance to the nearest clinic is mostly not associated with dropout rates in the vaccination series, but it delays the timing of vaccination, especially in the later stages of the vaccination series and Polio vaccination which require the mobilization from the supply side.Conclusion: A longer distance to the nearest health facility is associated with lower vaccine take-up and delayed timing of vaccinations, but not with vaccine dropout. More studies should focus on the dynamics of vaccination decisions, in particular, the different determinants of vaccine take-up and dropout.\",\n",
       " 'The evaluation of the public health impact of a vaccination program is essential in monitoring its policy relevance. Vaccine impact (VI) is usually assessed in a before-after design, in which data on disease burden without vaccination program is required from a historical reference period. It takes into account the indirect effects and therefore aims to describe the public health performance of the vaccination program in the population. Vaccine effectiveness (VE), measured in parallel settings, quantifies the benefit for an individual of being vaccinated but does not address the indirect effects of a vaccination program. The motivation of this paper is to gain insight into patterns of how VI and VE have manifested under large-scale use of a ten-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Finnish children. We construct a simple pseudo-dynamic model that mimics typical post-vaccination trends in the incidences of pneumococcal carriage and invasive disease in children when the proportion of vaccine-type carriage decreases. In the context of the model, we define the parameters of interest for VI and VE and explore how their expected values evolve over time. For comparison, we demonstrate the application of VI and VE estimation by using register data.',\n",
       " 'The susceptibility to infectious diseases in the elderly may be explained by the age-related physiological immune deficiency. Influenza and pneumococcal infections are the most frequent ones in this age. These infections can be efficiently prevented by vaccination, a fact that is often not considered. Other vaccinations should be considered in risk circumstances, such as travel to foreign countries. The lack of vaccination programs for the elderly constitutes a problem which should be resolved.',\n",
       " 'Infections are more common and generally more severe in neonates and young children than in older children and adults, mainly because immune defenses are functionally impaired in early life. The seriousness of the infectious problems of premature infants (PIs) is proportional to how premature they are, but irrespective of this, they are more serious than those of full-term infants because their immune system is compromised to a greater extent. This review analyzes our knowledge of the characteristics of the developing immune system, the impact of possible impairments on immunization, the real response of PIs to vaccines and the safety and tolerability of different vaccines. Overall, the data indicate that PIs should follow the same vaccination schedule as that generally used for full-term infants, without correcting for prematurity and regardless of birthweight. However, there is an urgent need for further studies concerning the use of recently marketed vaccines and those that will be marketed in the near future.',\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVES: Vaccine coverage for recommended vaccines is low among adults. The objective of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviours of adults and healthcare providers related to four vaccine-preventable diseases and vaccines (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, zoster, pneumococcus and influenza). DESIGN: We undertook a survey and focus groups of Canadian adults and healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, pharmacists). A total of 4023 adults completed the survey and 62 participated in the focus groups; 1167 providers completed the survey and 45 participated in the focus groups. RESULTS: Only 46.3% of adults thought they were up-to-date on their vaccines; 30% did not know. In contrast, 75.6% of providers reported being up-to-date. Only 57.5% of adults thought it was important to receive all recommended vaccines (compared to 87.1-91.5% of providers). Positive attitudes towards vaccines paralleled concern about the burden of illness and confidence in the vaccines, with providers being more aware of disease burden and confident in vaccine effectiveness than the public. Between 55.0% and 59.7% of adults reported willingness to be vaccinated if recommended by their healthcare provider. However, such recommendations were variable; while 77.4% of the public reported being offered and 52.8% reported being recommended the influenza vaccine by their provider, only 10.8% were offered and 5.6% recommended pertussis vaccine. Barriers and facilitators to improved vaccine coverage in adults, such as trust-mistrust of health authorities, pharmaceutical companies and national recommendations, autonomy versus the public good and logistical issues (such as insufficient time and lack of vaccination status tracking), were identified by both the public and providers. CONCLUSIONS: Despite guidelines for adult vaccination, there are substantial gaps in knowledge and attitudes and beliefs among both the public and healthcare providers that lead to low vaccine coverage. A systematic approach that involves education, elimination of barriers and establishing and improving infrastructure for adult immunisation is required.',\n",
       " 'Use of the oral poliovirus vaccine in the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) demands that the children vaccinated be seen four times during the first 10 months of life. In practice, this necessity presents considerable difficulties, which are expressed in particular by the high drop-out rate. Introduction of the new inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) into the vaccination program enables children to be effectively protected against the six diseases of the EPI in only two visits. Vaccination coverage is thus very significantly increased. At the same time, by reducing the number of visits, both the running costs and the investment costs can be decreased. However, the cost of the vaccines is going to rise noticeably because the production of the new IPV will remain a great deal more costly than the production of the live vaccine. An outline is provided of the likely price of the new concentrated and purified IPV. The efficacy/cost ratio, measured by the cost of completely vaccinating a child, will, nevertheless, be considerably improved. The new IPV therefore increases the feasibility of the EPI under most satisfactory economic conditions.',\n",
       " 'The acellular pertussis vaccine offers a better tolerance as compared with the whole cell pertussis vaccine. It has also a good protective effect against whooping cough. However given as a combined pentavalent vaccine for the primary immunization of infants, it appears to introduce an immune interference leading to a diminished response to the Haemophilus type b or poliomyelitis valence according to the type of vaccine. Thus it is recommended that immunization against whooping cough in France in the coming years uses whole cell pertussis combined vaccine for the primary immunization of infants at 2, 3 and 4 months, the acellular pertussis vaccine being used for the booster injections at 18 months and 10-11 years.',\n",

METHODS: An ecological study using secondary information for 2000 and 2003. Three indicators were measured: (1) gaps in coverage (understood as being the differences between municipal coverage and that at national level), (2) Gini coefficient and (3) Lorenz's curve. RESULTS: Decreasing national vaccination coverage was found, dropping from 78.8% in 2000 to 66.8% in 2003. The number of towns having gaps in their coverage also increased during the two years being studied. Vaccination coverage concentration coefficients and curves showed inequalities between the municipalities during the two years being studied, although Gini coefficients improved from 0.18 to 0.13 for vaccination coverage between 2000 and 2003. The anti-influenza vaccine had the greatest decrease in inequality during the years being studied, followed by the anti-hepatitis B vaccine. The smallest change was recorded for the tuberculosis vaccine (BCG). Poliovirus vaccine estimations lay between those for BCG and hepatitis B. CONCLUSIONS: Action should be focused on municipalities identified as having recurring low coverage and large gaps compared to the national level.\",\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVE: Between 2015 and 2018 The Netherlands experienced increases of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) serogroup W (MenW), from 0.02 cases/100,000 people between 2010 and 2014 up to 0.5 cases/100,000 in 2017. Therefore in 2018 the MenACWY vaccination was introduced in the National Immunisation Programme (NIP) and a catch-up campaign was initiated among adolescents. This study aimed to gain insight into the decision-making process within households regarding the MenACWY vaccination. The focus was on the differences in the decision-making process of parents and adolescents and of those that had accepted the MenACWY vaccination and those that had not, in order to assess how these types of decisions are made within households. METHOD: We conducted a total of 38 semi-structured interviews in 20 households (7 not vaccinated) with 20 parents and 18 adolescents (18 dyads) across The Netherlands concerning their decision-making process. Interview guides were constructed based on the Precaution Adaption Process (PAP) model. We performed thematic analysis using qualitative data analysis software (MAXQDA). RESULTS: Parents are the main actors in the household decision-making process regarding the MenACWY vaccination. Parents start their decision-making process before adolescents are even aware of the issue. Households in the study took different approaches in involving the adolescent in the decision-making, resulting in three styles of household decision-making: parents decide without the adolescent, parents involve the adolescent, or parents leave it up to the adolescent to decide. CONCLUSION: Parents influence adolescent reasoning, engagement and involvement during the MenACWY vaccination decision-making. And this is the case both among those that have accepted and rejected the MenACWY vaccination. Adolescent engagement with the MenACWY vaccination decision-making is either short-lived or non-existent. However, the moment offers opportunities to engage adolescents on vaccinations and decision-making, with parents as key figures to promote this.',\n",

METHODS: This cross-sectional study collected data via written survey to postpartum mothers in a large teaching hospital in Connecticut. We used multivariable analysis to identify mothers who were less trusting with regard to vaccines. RESULTS: Of 228 mothers who participated in the study, 29% of mothers worried about vaccinating their infants: 23% were worried the vaccines would not work, 11% were worried the doctor would give the wrong vaccine, and 8% worried that \"they\" are experimenting when they give vaccines. Mothers reported that the most important reasons to vaccinate were to prevent disease in the baby (74%) and in society (11%). Knowledge about vaccination was poor; e.g., 33% correctly matched chicken pox with varicella vaccine. Mothers who were planning to breastfeed (P=.01), were primiparous (P=.01), or had an income<$40,000 but did not receive support from the women, infants, and children (WIC) program were less trusting with regard to vaccines (P=.03). Although 70% wanted information about vaccines during pregnancy, only 18% reported receiving such information during prenatal care. CONCLUSION: Although the majority of infants receive vaccines, their mothers have concerns and would like to receive immunization information earlier. Mothers who are primiparous, have low family incomes but do not qualify for the WIC program, or are breastfeeding may need special attention to develop a trusting relationship around vaccination. Mothers would benefit from additional knowledge regarding the risks and benefits of vaccines particularly during prenatal care.',\n",
       " 'A flock of 86 weaned lambs was used in field conditions to test the vaccination against babesiasis in sheep, using blood containing up to 5 per cent Babesia ovis-infected erythrocytes, referred to as a \"live vaccine\". The blood was obtained through successive passages performed with the vaccinal strain in four spleenectomized lambs with the parallel treatment of the latter with tetracyclin. The application of the vaccine at rates of 1.75 X 10(7); 3.5 X 10(7); and 7 X 10(7) Babesia organisms was well tolerated, the animals responding with a temperature reaction only. The immunity acquired proved sufficiently stable against the experimental challenge with a triple dose of the maximal vaccinal one as well as against the natural infection to which the flock was exposed within the period between the third and sixth month following vaccination. At the same time babesiasis in an enzootic form developed in the control flock, the test flock showing no cases of diseased animals. The complement-fixing antibodies established from the tenth up to the 90th day after the vaccination was carried out served as an index of the immunity status. The optimal vaccination dose is suggested to be that containing 3.5 X 10(7) Babesiae.',\n",

In Ghana, access complete vaccination coverage is 77%. However, sustaining high coverages in island communities such as Kwahu Afram Plains North (KAPN) is still a challenge. METHODS: Study site and settings, an Island district. It targeted children aged 12-23 months. We used a modified WHO EPI 30 by 7 cluster sampling approach. Semi-structured questionnaires were employed for data collection. Wincosas and EpiInfo were used for data entry, management and analysis. The vaccination coverage, antigen-specific coverage calculated. The probability was set at 0.05 and the value was calculated to determine statistical significance of association. RESULTS: Of the 480 records of children analysed, fully vaccinated accounted 81.3%, partially 16.7% and not vaccinated at all 2.1%. Access was 97.3% and utilization 91.2% with Pentavalent 1-3 dropout rate of 8.8%. Coverage for specific antigens were: BCG (97.1%), OPV 1/Pentavalent 1/PCV 1/Rotarix 1 (97.3%), OPV2/ Pentavalent 2/PCV 2/Rotarix 2 (94.0%), OPV3/ Pentavalent3/PCV 3 (88.8%), MR (87.7%) and YF (87.7%). Vaccination card availability, higher educational level of mothers and lower parity levels were significantly associated (p < 0.05) positively with childhood vaccination status. Invalid doses were 21.6% of childhood total vaccinations. Key reasons accounting for non-vaccination were: distant place of immunization 34.4 % (31/90), mother being busy 14.4% (13/90), vaccine unavailability 10.0% (9/90) and fears of side reactions 8.9% (8/90). CONCLUSION: EPI childhood vaccination coverage for January, 2016 in KAPN District was high. There is the need to focus on counteracting the reasons identified to account for vaccination failure.

       " 'Vaccines can alter the dynamic interaction of an infectious agent with a host in complex ways. The effect of routine childhood immunization on age-specific cases was studied in an age-structured population, assuming different vaccine effects at the individual level. Assumptions about vaccine efficacy include partial protection to infection and disease, reduction in infectiousness, waning of protection, and boosting of the level and duration of protection by natural infection. The concept of relative pathogenicity is introduced to describe the effect of a vaccine on the development of disease conditional on being infected. The concepts of the immunologically naive susceptible, naive susceptible equivalent, and relative residual infection potential are introduced in the context of defining the reproduction number of a population vaccinated with a partially protective vaccine. Sensitivity to boosting has a particularly pronounced effect in reducing the number of older vaccinated cases. Near the threshold for eliminating transmission, the dynamic behavior and number as well as age distribution of cases is very sensitive to the degree of protection and relative residual infectiousness. The number of unvaccinated cases is more sensitive to the level of coverage than to the type of vaccine, while the number of vaccinated cases is very sensitive to assumptions about vaccine efficacy.',\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: Antenatal influenza vaccination (AIV) is an effective intervention for protecting pregnant women and their newborns against influenza. Although the World Health Organization recommends AIV at any stage of pregnancy, in low- and middle-income countries, including India, it is rarely provided. Research suggests that antenatal care (ANC) provider practices explain much of this limited coverage. Our study in urban Pune, India, assessed the feasibility of a two-stage clinician-engagement strategy to reduce missed opportunities for AIV in urban private-practice ANC clinics. METHODS: Clinicians were randomized to intervention and control groups in slum and middle-class study sites. Intervention-group clinicians (active clinicians) were assessed on vaccination-related views and practices, and were presented with authoritative AIV recommendations from global, academic and professional medical organizations. In a second meeting after a community survey, findings concerning vaccination-related views and experiences were explained to active clinicians. Assessments of community vaccination views were not provided to control-group clinicians. Both groups maintained logs of ANC clinic visit vaccination status throughout the 11-month study period to enable identification of missed and taken opportunities for vaccination. Analyses were restricted to visits of women in their third trimester without previous AIV in the current pregnancy. RESULTS: Overall, 30 clinicians participated. After first and second interactions, active clinicians in middle-class communities vaccinated at 12.2% and 37.8%, respectively. Middle-class control clinicians vaccinated at <0.2% throughout the study. This difference in AIV taken opportunities between middle-class active and control clinics was statistically significant (p\\u202f<\\u202f0.05) after first and second interactions. In slum-community sites, active clinicians' AIV activity was minimal throughout. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach for engaging clinicians effectively reduced missed opportunities for AIV in urban middle-class settings of Pune. It may also improve maternal vaccination for other conditions. The absence of any similar effect in slum-based clinics likely reflects critical limitations of vaccine access.\",\n",
       " 'Hepatitis B vaccine has been used for over 10 years. It is efficient and safe. Protection of risk groups against hepatitis B virus infection is now achieved and vaccination of newborns and adolescents is a main public health problem. Bad responders are well characterized and immunomodulatory interventions (cytokines) must be tested in these patients. Response to hepatitis B vaccine is genetically determined and the possibility of vaccine induced escape mutants should lead to careful epidemiological studies of the spread of hepatitis B virus infection.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Vaccination centres in the Campania Region, southern Italy, vaccinate children with a hexavalent vaccine that contains the mandatory vaccines diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis, and viral Hepatitis B. This vaccine also includes two non-mandatory vaccines, pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae type B. Information about these optional vaccines should be communicated to the parents, and informed consent should be obtained from parents before vaccination. We explored whether informed consent was delivered to the parents, whether they signed the consent form, and whether they read and acquired the information about the vaccination that their child would receive. METHODS: Childhood immunisations are provided at specific public health vaccination centres, \"Unità\\xa0Operative Materno-infantili\\'s\" (UOMIs). We selected four UOMI from the Campania Region where we interviewed 1039 parents bringing their children for the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd doses of hexavalent vaccine. The consent forms were collected from the four vaccination centres and were analysed with respect to clarity and completeness. RESULTS: Most of the respondents (89.5%) were mothers between 20 and 39\\xa0years of age (80.4% vs 59.6% of the fathers), they were married (87.2% vs 93.5% of the fathers), and only one-half of them were employed (50.2% vs 92.6% of the fathers). The informed consent form was received from 58.1% of the parents and signed by 52.8%, but read by 35.0% of them. Only 1.5% of parents knew which vaccines were mandatory, and 25.0% of them believed that the entire hexavalent vaccine was mandatory. When we asked the parents which non-mandatory vaccinations were administered to their children, only 0.5% indicated the Haemophilus influenzae type B and none indicated the pertussis vaccine. Thirty-six per cent of the parents replied that their child had not received any non-mandatory vaccines. No parents were informed by the operators that their children would receive non-mandatory vaccines. CONCLUSION: In our study, consent procedures did not allow parents to acquire correct information about vaccine options for their children. Furthermore, not one health care provider informed parents that their child was receiving non-mandatory vaccines. The informed consent process and the individual health care providers did not properly inform parents about the vaccines administered to their children.',\n",

Monitoring of annual vaccination coverage levels over time is necessary to characterize undervaccination. Here, coverage estimates for 1996 (1997 for varicella) were compared with those of 1999. METHODS: Immunization coverage among children aged 19 to 35 months in 1996 (1997 for varicella) and 1999 for a variety of vaccines and vaccine series were compared using Wald chi-square tests and data from the National Immunization Survey. RESULTS: Record high immunization coverage among children aged 19 to 35 months in the United States has increased by a statistically significant amount between 1996 and 1999 for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis; measles, mumps, and rubella; Haemophilus influenzae type b; hepatitis B; and standard series made up of these individual vaccines. Coverage with the vaccine for varicella dramatically increased between 1997 and 1999. However, between 1996 and 1999, coverage with three or more doses of polio vaccine decreased by a small but statistically significant amount. CONCLUSION: Despite the drop for polio vaccine, coverage remains high. Continued monitoring is required to determine if the drop in polio coverage is a cause for concern.',\n",
       " 'Because adolescents make relatively few visits to clinics for preventive care, their vaccination rates suffer. We examined rates among Minnesota youths to see how they compared with those among teens throughout the United States. We used National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen) data to estimate vaccination rates for 13- to 17-year-olds in Minnesota from 2008 through 2013 and compared them to national rates for MCV4, Tdap and HPV vaccines. We also examined rates of provider recommendation for each of the three vaccines and rates of parental intention to vaccinate against HPV. We found rates for all three vaccinations increased between 2008 and 2013, but they continue to be low for both MCV4 (69%) and HPV (38% of females and 9% of males completed the three-dose series in 2013). Fortunately, the percentage of Minnesota clinicians recommending those vaccines is increasing (the percentage recommending HPV vaccination for females increased from 55% in 2008 to 74% in 2013; however, only 44% recommended it for males in 2013). The percentage of parents in Minnesota reporting intent to vaccinate their female children against HPV rose from 52% in 2008 to 58% in 2013; the percentage intending to vaccinate their male children rose from 16% in 2010 to 47% in 2013. Clinicians and public health officials must address how we can improve HPV vaccination rates among adolescents.',\n",
       " 'AIM: Our objectives were to measure the vaccine coverage rates for children with chronic diseases as well as the prevalence of potentially harmful delays for generally recommended vaccines. We also identified the factors influencing non-adherence to vaccines specifically recommended for chronic conditions. METHODS: Three non-interventional point-prevalence surveys were performed in 2014 in all paediatric units at Lille University Hospital among children aged 2\\xa0months-18\\xa0years with chronic diseases and vaccination data. Vaccine coverage and delays for generally recommended vaccines were studied. The children who were up-to-date and those under-vaccinated for specifically indicated vaccines were compared and the factors potentially associated with under-vaccination were studied with multivariable analysis. RESULTS: We screened 682 patients: of 207 with chronic diseases, mainly neurological, muscular and respiratory disorders, 146 had vaccination data. Only 47% (95% confidence interval 39-55) were up-to-date for all generally recommended vaccinations; potentially harmful vaccination delays were high (26%-75%). Only 11% of the 81% of patients for whom some vaccines were specifically recommended were up-to-date. Low maternal education level was significantly associated with under-vaccination (adjusted odds ratio 10.5, 95% confidence interval 1.3-86.9, P\\xa0=\\xa0.03). CONCLUSION: This study showed inadequate vaccine coverage rates and significant delays among children with chronic diseases.',\n",
       " 'Infectious diseases are the main cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The development of successful vaccines is thus one of the major achievements in medical history and may have saved more lives than antibiotics. Whereas the first vaccines were developed in a rather empiric way, new insights into the immunological mechanisms of a successful vaccine response allow modifications of the generally used vaccination protocols and are a prerequisite for the generation of vaccines against new pathogens such as HIV, malaria, dengue virus and others. The aim of effective vaccine development is an avirulent, non-invasive, non-replicating vaccine, which induces long-lived, pathogen-specific immune responses. The addition of adjuvants, modifications of the dose, dose interval and application route can improve antibody-titers and cellular immune responses and thus improve vaccination outcome. On the other hand primary or secondary immunodeficiency leads to an increased susceptibility for infectious diseases and impaired immune responses to vaccinations. These patients should be vaccinated with dead vaccines, whereas live vaccines are generally contraindicated. Here we summarize current and future approaches to enhance vaccine induced immune responses and highlight some of the issues of vaccinations in immunosuppressed individuals.',\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: To minimise vaccine-associated risk of intussusception following rotavirus vaccination, Norway adopted very strict age limits for initiating and completing the vaccine series at the time rotavirus vaccination was included in the national immunisation programme, October 2014. Although Norway has a high coverage for routine childhood vaccines, these stringent age limits could negatively affect rotavirus coverage. We documented the status and impact of rotavirus vaccination on other infant vaccines during the first year after its introduction. METHODS: We used individual vaccination data from the national immunisation register to calculate coverage for rotavirus and other vaccines and examine adherence with the recommended schedules. We identified factors associated with completing the full rotavirus series by performing multiple logistic regression analyses. We also evaluated potential changes in uptake and timeliness of other routine vaccines after the introduction of rotavirus vaccine using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The national coverage for rotavirus vaccine achieved a year after the introduction was 89% for one dose and 82% for two doses, respectively. Among fully rotavirus-vaccinated children, 98% received both doses within the upper age limit and 90% received both doses according to the recommended schedule. The child's age at the initiation of rotavirus series and being vaccinated with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTaP/IPV/Hib) and pneumococcal vaccines were the strongest predictors of completing the full rotavirus series. No major changes in uptake and timeliness of other paediatric vaccines were observed after introduction of rotavirus vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Norway achieved a high national coverage and excellent adherence with the strict age limits for rotavirus vaccine administration during the first year of introduction, indicating robustness of the national immunisation programme. Rotavirus vaccination did not impact coverage or timeliness of other infant vaccines.\",\n",
       " 'The efficacy and safety of a vaccination during anaesthesia was examined in 20 puppies from 8 litters of one kennel. The animals were vaccinated in a state of reflex-free anaesthesia (neuroleptanalgesia in combination with halothane, nitrous oxide and oxygen). 20 puppies from the same litters were used as controls. A parvovirus living vaccine (Canimed) and a rabies vaccine from inactivated viruses (Rabisin) were used for the vaccinations. The titers of neutralizing antibodies against rabies virus were significantly lower in the group of anaesthetized animals compared to the control group on the 10th and 20th day p.vacc. The average titers of antibodies against parvovirus of both groups, however, do not allow any statistically significant statements. It is nevertheless remarkable that 6 of the anaesthetized puppies (three different litters) showed no increase in antibodies. The results of the investigations lead to the recommendation not to vaccinate anaesthetized puppies. The risk of reducing the efficacy of vaccinations with vaccines from inactivated agents is greater than with living vaccines.',\n",
       " 'The intention to delay or avoid vaccines that are recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices can be described as \"vaccine hesitancy.\" While outright refusal of all vaccines is uncommon, hesitancy is seen on a regular basis in most primary care offices, resulting in immunization delay and prolonged susceptibility to preventable disease. The consequences of vaccine hesitancy include the potential for resurgence of vaccine preventable infections. Open, honest, and frank discussions with hesitant patients and their families can assist in their understanding of the importance of vaccines. While many experienced providers are able to do so in an intuitive manner, others may benefit from developing a systemic framework for such discussions. An understanding of the history and rationale for vaccine hesitancy is a first step in regaining lost public confidence in our robust immunization programs.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: International guidelines recommend vaccinating allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients at 3 months after transplant, giving 3 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) followed by either a dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PSV23) or a fourth PCV dose in the case of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). However, the long-term immunity after this regimen is unknown, and there is no recommendation from 24 months after transplant regarding boosts. Our objective was to assess the antipneumococcal antibody titers and seroprotection rates of allogeneic HCT recipients years after different schedules of vaccination. METHODS: We assessed 100 adult HCT recipients a median of 9.3 years (range: 1.7-40) after transplant. All patients had received at least one dose of PCV and were assessed for antipneumococcal immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers against the 7 serotypes shared by PCV7, PCV13, and PSV23. Sixty-six percent of the patients had been vaccinated according to the current guidelines. RESULTS: Considering an IgG titer ≥ 0.35 µg/mL as protective for each serotype, the seroprotection rate was 50% for 7/7 serotypes and 70% for 5/7 serotypes, with no differences between the different vaccination schedules. The lack of seroprotection was associated with a transplant performed not in complete remission or from a cord-blood unit, a relapse after transplant, or chronic GvHD at assessment. CONCLUSION: Because only half of the vaccinated patients had long-term protection, pending prospective studies defining the best boost program after the initial one, we recommend the assessment of specific IgG titers starting from 24 months to decide for further doses.',\n",
       " \"The recommended childhood immunization schedule is complex, with multiple doses of vaccines required to complete the series. For a variety of reasons, a single manufacturer's product may not be available for all of the doses needed. In addition, combination products may become available, allowing for fewer injections to be administered but resulting in a change of vaccine components. To ensure the timely immunization of children and to avoid missed opportunities to vaccinate, it is important to be familiar with data documenting the interchangeability of vaccines. Although clear evidence is available to demonstrate the interchangeability of some vaccines (i.e., hepatitis B vaccines and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines), it is more difficult to evaluate the interchangeability of others (i.e., diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis [DTaP] vaccines). Limited data support the interchangeability of some DTaP products when necessary. This article presents the safety and immunogenicity data for immunization regimens that use vaccines from different manufacturers.\",\n",

Evidences are unanimous in recommending splenectomised patients to receive meningococcal, antipneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccinations according to a specific timing. In Italy there are no current data on the immunisation coverage in these patients. This study aims to investigate immunisation coverage in patients undergoing elective or urgent splenectomy for 2012-2013 in the 3 Apulian hospitals. The patients discharged with the code ICD-9-CM 41.5 - \"Total splenectomy\" were enrolled. The administration of vaccines was verified through consultation of medical records, archives of general practitioners and vaccination offices. In the study period, 166 subjects underwent splenectomy and none of them received vaccinations during hospitalization. 25 splenectomised patients (15.1%) received at least one of the recommended vaccinations. 21 patients (12.6%) received vaccine against Streptococcus pneumonia, 13 (7.8%) meningococcal vaccine, 10 patients (6%) Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine. The low vaccination coverage could be due both to poor perception of the risk of infection and to a lack of knowledge on vaccinations by surgeons. For this reason it is necessary to draw up and share operational protocols that establish the administration of vaccines.',\n",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 205 pigs were surgically castrated (group K) and 191 were vaccinated twice (group V) using the boar taint vaccine (Improvac®; 2ml s.c.). The first dose was administered atthe age of 12 weeks when the animals were moved into the fattening unit and the second dose in week 18, 4-6 weeks before the planned slaughter date. Live weights were recorded in weeks 1, 4, 12, 18, and 22. In weeks 18 and 20, length and width of the testicles of 171 animals of group V were measured. After slaughtering cold carcass weight, back fat depth, muscle thickness, percent lean meat, and fat and muscle areas of the carcasses were determined. A piece of the neck muscle from each pig was used to conduct a cooking and melting sensory test. RESULTS: While no significant weight difference was evident in week 22 (K=89.4kg; V=88.6kg), cold carcass weight, and back fat and muscle thickness were lower for vaccinates. Vaccinates had higher average daily weight gains (ADW) after the second injection from week 18 up to the cut-off weighing in week 22 (V=1121g; K=1007g; p<0.001) in contrast to average daily weight gains between weeks 12 and 18 (K=740g; V=668g; p<0.001). After the second injection, testicle size of vaccinated pigs decreased significantly. All animals were negative for boar taint by both cooking and melting tests. CONCLUSION: Boars vaccinated against boar taint had lower ADW before the second vaccination, but compensated the weight difference after complete vaccination. The significant reduction in the testicle size after the second injection indicates a vaccination success. After vaccination no boar taint was detected in carcasses. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Vaccination as well as surgical castration reliably prevents the incidence of boar taint. The late rise in daily gain can be beneficial if management is aligned.',\n",

Forty goats were divided into four equal groups. Group 1 was vaccinated twice intranasally with formalin-killed Pasteurella haemolytica A2, group 2 was vaccinated twice intramuscularly with an oil adjuvant vaccine containing P haemolytica A7, and group 3 was initially vaccinated intranasally with the formalin-killed P haemolytica A2 followed by intramuscular vaccination with the oil adjuvant vaccine. In each group the two vaccinations were carried out four weeks apart. Group 4 was the unvaccinated control group. All goats were challenged intratracheally with 4 ml of an inoculum containing live P haemolytica A2 at a concentration of 1.3 x 10(7) colony forming units/ml two weeks after the last vaccination and were killed 14 days after the challenge. Although group 2 showed the highest clinical score following the challenge, deaths were observed only in group 3. Three goats in group 1 had pneumonic lung lesions, compared with six goats in group 2 and all the goats in groups 3 and 4. The lung lesions in group 1 were significantly (P < 0.05) less severe than in groups 3 and 4. Similarly, the lesions in group 2 were markedly less severe than in groups 3 and 4, although the differences were not significant. The difference between the extent of the lung lesions in the goats in groups 1 and 2 was not significant.

       " 'OBJECTIVE: To review the most common neurological disorders associated with various vaccines, and offer suggestions aiming at a better understanding if a causal relationship between the neurological complications and the vaccination is feasible. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed using combination of the following items: vaccines, vaccination, immunization and neurological complications. Review of reports and publications from the World Health Organizations, US Centers for Disease Control and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System regarding safety and common neurological complications following vaccinations. Especial attention was given to the incidence of complications in various Latin American countries. RESULTS: Neurological complications following vaccination are rare, and in most cases, represent a monophasic neurological event with good clinical recovery. However, serious and fatal complications have been reported. In general, neurological adverse events may not be causally related to the vaccine, and occur at much lower rates than same events following natural disease. DISCUSSION: Recent climatic changes and frequent international travel have changed the epidemiological spectrum of some infectious diseases. In view of the rapidly growing number of vaccines available and the need to implement massive immunization campaigns in several regions of the world, it is imperative to understand the potential adverse reactions of vaccinations. Neurological disorders are among the most serious, and on rare occasions, life-threatening complications after vaccination.',\n",
       " 'Influenza vaccinations and antiviral drugs are the foundation of epidemic and pandemic preparedness, but only close collaboration between public health authorities and industry can achieve the necessary production levels and ensure the smooth distribution necessary to protect European citizens from this public health scourge. To focus the minds of all public health stakeholders, ESWI has translated these simple facts into clear achievable goals: it recommends that EU governments vaccinate one-third of their populations by 2010 and stockpile antiviral drugs for 20% of their citizens while promoting public-private partnerships. The scientific justification behind this objective is easily understood namely that while the annual flu shot protects against three viral strains,the pandemic vaccine will focus on only the one highly lethal virus. As a result if countries succeed in meeting the target to vaccine one-third of the EU-25 population with a trivalent vaccine, sufficient monovalent pandemic vaccine could be produced to vaccinate almost the entire EU-25 population at least once. Achieving these objectives would go far to containing the pandemic and ensuring necessary treatment to avoid needless deaths and social and economic disruption. It would also signal that influenza preparedness had become part of the European mindset. Relying on the technique of force-field analysis organised by professional facilitators the session asked government representatives and policy makers to identify existing factors that either provide support for the objectives or hinder progress.',\n",

Of 274,000 deaths due to cervical cancer each year, more than 80% occur in developing countries, and this proportion is expected to increase to 90% by 2020. Up to 70% of sexually active women will become infected with human papilloma virus (HPV) during their lifetime. Even though screening reduces the risk of cervical cancer, it does not prevent HPV infection or development of precancerous lesions which need careful follow-up and often need excision. It was observed in a study, pre-adolescent vaccination alone reduced cancer incidence by 44% and was more effective than screening alone. A combined approach of pre-adolescent vaccination and screening of adult women was more effective than either alone. The high probability of acquiring HPV infection once, one has become sexually active raises the question of whether the vaccine will be effective if given to girls who have already been infected with HPV type 16 or 18.

However, the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare withdrew the recommendation for the HPV vaccination in June 2013. We investigated HPV vaccine injury compensation programs for both the national and local governments. Approximately 3.38 million girls were vaccinated, and 2,584 complained of health problems. The majority of these received the vaccine shot as a non-routine vaccination. In total, 98 people developed health problems and applied for assistance from 2011 to 2014, but no cases have been processed since October 2014. Several local governments are providing their own compensation program for cases of vaccine adverse reactions, but the number is extremely low (16 of 1,741 municipalities and 1 of 47 prefectures). The local governments that are providing compensation are largely those where HPV vaccine victim support groups are prominent. The confusion regarding the national program for HPV vaccine injury was caused by the discrepancy between the compensation programs for those vaccinated under the immunization law and for those who received voluntary vaccinations. The establishment of a new compensation program might be key to finding a lasting resolution.',\n",

This was an open label, non-controlled, non-randomized Phase I clinical trial. Healthy previously BCG-vaccinated adult subjects were enrolled sequentially into three groups and vaccinated with FP85A alone, or both FP85A and MVA85A, with a four week interval between vaccinations. Passive and active data on adverse events were collected. Immunogenicity was evaluated by Enzyme Linked Immunospot (ELISpot), flow cytometry and Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Most adverse events were mild and there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. FP85A vaccination did not enhance antigen 85A-specific cellular immunity. When MVA85A vaccination was preceded by FP85A vaccination, cellular immune responses were lower compared with when MVA85A vaccination was the first immunisation. MVA85A vaccination, but not FP85A vaccination, induced anti-MVA IgG antibodies. Both MVA85A and FP85A vaccinations induced anti-FP9 IgG antibodies. In conclusion, FP85A vaccination was well tolerated but did not induce antigen-specific cellular immune responses. We hypothesize that FP85A induced anti-FP9 IgG antibodies with cross-reactivity for MVA85A, which may have mediated inhibition of the immune response to subsequent MVA85A.

       " \"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate associations of risk perception, self-efficacy and response-efficacy with HPV vaccination decisions among parents/guardians of adolescents. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of parents/guardians of adolescents was conducted at the Minnesota State Fair. Risk perception was measured by participant rankings of HPV infection and vaccine risks against diseases/side-effects for which numerical risks were provided. Response efficacy was measured as perceived ability of the vaccine to prevent HPV infection, and self-efficacy was measured as the perceived ability to prevent infection without vaccination (scale 0-100). Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests compared risk perception, self-efficacy and response-efficacy of vaccinators to non-vaccinators. RESULTS: Of 405 eligible participants, 355 completed vaccination questions; 304 (86%) were vaccinators and 51 (14%) were non-vaccinators. Non-vaccinators had lower risk-perception of HPV-related cancers (p\\xa0<\\xa00.05) and higher risk-perception of vaccine-related side-effects (p\\xa0<\\xa00.05). Self-efficacy was higher (64\\xa0±\\xa024 vs. 30\\xa0±\\xa029; p\\xa0<\\xa00.0001) and perceived HPV vaccine response efficacy was lower (52\\xa0±\\xa031 vs. 83\\xa0±\\xa019; p\\xa0<\\xa00.0001) among non-vaccinators compared to vaccinators. CONCLUSIONS: Lower HPV-related cancer risk perception and higher self-efficacy were associated with the decision not to vaccinate. HPV vaccination decisions were similar to meningococcal vaccination decisions, suggesting reluctance to vaccinate in general rather than resistance to the HPV vaccine specifically drove the results.\",\n",
       " 'In the USA, influenza vaccines are available as parenteral injections or as an intranasal preparation. Injectable influenza vaccines are available in either multidose vial (MDV), single-dose vial or prefilled syringe (PFS) presentations. PFSs have gained market share in the USA but have not yet reached the levels of uptake currently seen in Western Europe. Here, we review the topic of vaccine presentation in the USA, with a special focus on influenza vaccines. Second, we present the results of a time-motion study that measured administration costs of influenza vaccination comparing MDVs versus PFSs during the 2009/2010 influenza campaign. Vaccinating with MDVs took an average 37.3 s longer than PFSs. The cost of administering 1000 immunizations in 2009 using MDVs were US$8596 versus US$8920.21 using PFSs. In a pandemic situation where 300 million Americans would require vaccination, PFSs would save 3.12 million h in healthcare worker time, worth US$111.1 million. The higher acquisition costs of PFS vaccines compared with MDVs are offset by lower administrative costs and increased safety.',\n",

       " \"Vaccines always will involve some risk, and risk always involves some public concern. Although the benefits of routine vaccination greatly outweigh any adverse effects, our consumer society seeks to eliminate all risk. The balance of risk and benefit appears to falter by the very success of preventing disease: in the immediate absence of the disease, the resolve to vaccinate waivers. We cannot expect the public to think in terms of the decision analyst and carefully weigh probability, risk, and benefit in a numerical fashion. In fact, the public's approach toward vaccination is varied and unscientific. Recognizing these challenges, we propose a program of continued vigilance by increasing our scientific base and methodology, improving vaccine safety communication through research and resources, maintaining a tolerance of conscientious objection as a safety valve for mandated routine vaccination in civilians, and calling for more research funding for the development of new vaccines.\",\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Germany introduced routine varicella (V) vaccination in 2004. Due to a slightly increased risk of febrile convulsions after first-dose application of combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine separate first-dose vaccinations with MMR and monovalent V vaccine were recommended in September 2011. METHODS: We compared V and MMR vaccinations in paediatric practices from two surveillance regions (Munich and Würzburg) one year before and after the change in the recommendation. RESULTS: A total of 1405/326 monthly reports were provided by a monthly average of 79/14 practices participating in Munich/Würzburg. V first-dose vaccinations (monovalent V or MMRV vaccine) declined by 12% in Munich (from 10.1 to 8.9 vaccinations per month and practice; p<0.005) and by 4% in Würzburg (from 9.9 to 9.5; p=0.620), respectively. First-dose vaccinations for MMR (MMR or MMRV vaccine) did not change significantly in both regions. CONCLUSION: Acceptance of V vaccination depends in part on the use of combination vaccine.',\n",

       " 'Understanding the change in intention for influenza vaccine among health-care workers (HCWs) is important to increase influenza vaccination uptake. We aimed to investigate the psychosocial beliefs associated with a change in the intention for influenza vaccine. An anonymous cross-sectional survey was distributed to tertiary hospital HCWs in 2016. Of 3007 HCWs, 70% were compliant (vaccinated, with an intention to revaccinate), 8% were resistant (unvaccinated, without intention to vaccinate), 10% had positive change (unvaccinated, but with intention) and 12% had negative change (vaccinated, but without intention). Across HCW groups, medical staff had both the highest proportion receiving all influenza vaccinations in the last 5 years (101, 28.4%), as well as the highest proportion who had never received vaccination (41, 11.5%). With increasing age, HCWs were less likely to have a negative (p = .02) or positive change (p = .06) in intention, compared to the vaccine-resistant group. HCWs were more likely to be compliant or have a positive change in intention to receive influenza vaccine, if they perceived the vaccine as effective, safe, or had a higher frequency of influenza vaccination in the last 5 years (all with p < .05). HCWs who were medical staff, who believed that side effects of the vaccine were common, or had worked for 6 to 10 years (vs 5 years or less) were less likely to be compliant (all with p < .05). In conclusion, older HCWs were more likely to maintain the status quo in their behavior toward influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccination strategies should place emphasis on vaccine effectiveness and safety.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Noroviruses are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis and foodborne diarrheal disease in the United States. Norovirus vaccine development has progressed in recent years, but critical questions remain regarding which age groups should be vaccinated to maximize population impact. METHODS: We developed a deterministic, age-structured compartmental model of norovirus transmission and immunity in the U.S. POPULATION: The model was fit to age-specific monthly U.S. hospitalizations between 1996 and 2007. We simulated mass immunization of both pediatric and elderly populations assuming realistic coverages of 90% and 65%, respectively. We considered two mechanism of vaccine action, resulting in lower vaccine efficacy (lVE) between 22% and 43% and higher VE (hVE) of 50%. RESULTS: Pediatric vaccination was predicted to avert 33% (95% CI: 27%, 40%) and 60% (95% CI: 49%, 71%) of norovirus episodes among children under five years for lVE and hVE, respectively. Vaccinating the elderly averted 17% (95% CI: 12%, 20%) and 38% (95% CI: 34%, 42%) of cases in 65+ year olds for lVE and hVE, respectively. At a population level, pediatric vaccination was predicted to avert 18-21 times more cases and twice as many deaths per vaccinee compared to elderly vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The potential benefits are likely greater for a pediatric program, both via direct protection of vaccinated children and indirect protection of unvaccinated individuals, including adults and the elderly. These findings argue for a clinical development plan that will deliver a vaccine with a safety and efficacy profile suitable for use in children.',\n",
       " 'Vaccinations are one of the most successful public health measures. However, vaccinations are not without risks. An improved infrastructure is needed to facilitate the conduct of large clinical trials and/or phase IV studies. Vaccination registers and large linked database studies are examples of such structural improvements. A vaccination register pilot project carried out by the Swedish Institute of Infectious Disease Control (SIIDC) showed that parents with few exceptions gave consent to enrolling their children in the pilot register and that bar code labelling of vaccines is a reliable and practical manner in which to record vaccinations. Two EU projects with the aim to improve the information infrastructure have recently started. In the project Development of Vaccination Registers existing and planned immunisation registers are reviewed and a plan of action will be proposed. The aim of the project EUSAFEVAC is to improve vaccine safety through systematic reviews of the literature, to develop standard case definitions, to develop a model immunisation register and to improve reporting systems. SIIDC in collaboration with the Swedish National Board for Health and Welfare and the Medical Products Agency is exploring the feasibility of establishing a Swedish immunisation register and linked database information system.',\n",
       " \"This study investigates boys' awareness and thoughts about human papillomavirus (HPV) and HPV vaccination, perceived benefits of vaccinating men, information sources and intention to be vaccinated against HPV. We used a qualitative approach and interviews were conducted with 31 upper secondary school male students. Two main themes 1) Promotion of equal health and 2) Increased knowledge facilitates the decision about HPV vaccination emerged from the analysis. The informants believed that it was important and fair to protect boys and girls equally against HPV. If HPV vaccination could prevent both girls and boys against an HPV-related disease, there was nothing to question or to discuss. It was not a matter of sex; it was a matter of equal rights. Moreover, an important reason for vaccinating boys was to prevent the transmission of the virus. However, the boys felt unsure and stated that they needed to know more. The school nurse and the school health were considered suitable both for distributing information and for providing the vaccinations. In conclusion, the participants were in favor of introducing HPV vaccination also for boys in the national vaccination program. Sex-neutral HPV vaccinations were viewed both as a way to stop the virus transmission and a means to promote equal health for the entire population.\",\n",
       " \"The widespread use of multidose vaccine containers in low and middle income countries' immunization programs is assumed to have multiple benefits and efficiencies for health systems, yet the broader impacts on immunization coverage, costs, and safety are not well understood. To document what is known on this topic, how it has been studied, and confirm the gaps in evidence that allow us to assess the complex system interactions, the authors undertook a review of published literature that explored the relationship between doses per container and immunization systems. The relationships examined in this study are organized within a systems framework consisting of operational costs, timely coverage, safety, product costs/wastage, and policy/correct use, with the idea that a change in dose per container affects all of them, and the optimal solution will depend on what is prioritized and used to measure performance. Studies on this topic are limited and largely rely on modeling to assess the relationship between doses per container and other aspects of immunization systems. Very few studies attempt to look at how a change in doses per container affects vaccination coverage rates and other systems components simultaneously. This article summarizes the published knowledge on this topic to date and suggests areas of current and future research to ultimately improve decision making around vaccine doses per container and increase understanding of how this decision relates to other program goals.\",\n",

Till 2008 the program did not include routine administration of vaccine against Varicella (chickenpox). For the past 7 years, however, vaccine against Varicella has been available to the public and subsidized through the health maintenance organizations (HMOs). On the eve of probable introduction of the Varicella Zoster Vaccine (VZ-V) into the INVP a study was conducted to examine factors postulated to be of importance in vaccination uptake. These factors can be assessed while the vaccine is only administered through active choice, as opposed to administration by default as part of INVP. The study group comprised the communities in the District of Haifa. The aim of the study was to assess vaccination rates and contributing factors in the decision to vaccinate or not vaccinate against VZ. The study showed that uptake of VZ-V was in correlation with: 1. Population group (i.e. religious denomination)--Jews were more likely to vaccinate (OR=3.88). 2. Level of education--parents with higher level of education were more likely to vaccinate. (OR=1.91). 3. Level of religious observance--non-observant parents were more likely to vaccinate (OR=2.7) 4.

Additional vaccinations with up to three standard doses of hepatitis B vaccine were given to 26 individuals, nine of whom developed anti-HBS titers higher than 10 IU/l after one additional vaccination. Two subjects received no further vaccination. The remaining group of 15 persons were given 2 more injections. After six vaccinations, nine subjects had an anti-HBs response of more than 10 IU/l, while six still had no detectable anti-HBs. In conclusion, supplementary vaccination of healthy hypo- and non-responders after standard hepatitis B vaccination induced an anti-HBs titer greater than 10 IU/l in 38% after one and in 75% after three additional doses of 20 micrograms of hepatitis B vaccine given intramuscularly.',\n",
       " 'The aim of this study was to determine influenza vaccine coverage among children aged 0-18 years in inner city practices in Poland in the 2009/2010 season and factors that might have influenced low vaccination coverage. A retrospective review of 11,735 vaccination charts of children aged 0-18 from seven randomly selected general practices in the capital city of Warsaw and one large practice in the city of Wroclaw was performed. We calculated the numbers of children who were vaccinated in the 2009/2010 season and analyzed the age distribution of vaccinated children. We also reviewed the vaccination history in patients who were vaccinated against influenza including: previous influenza vaccinations, modification (widening) of standard immunization scheme, and a proportion of children who completed the recommended two-dose schedule of vaccination. In the calculations, 95% confidence intervals were used. Out of the total of 11,735 children surveyed, 362 (3.1%, CI: 2.8-3.4%) were vaccinated against influenza in the 2009/2010 season. For 115 of these 362 (31.8%, CI: 27.0-36.6%) children it was their first vaccination against influenza. The mean age of a vaccinated child was 6.0 ± 4.3 years. Children aged 2-5 were most commonly vaccinated (153/362, 42.3%, CI: 37.2-47.4%), while infants (aged 6-12 months) were vaccinated rarely (15/362, 4.4%, CI: 2.2-6.2%). In the group of children younger than 8 years (86/362 children) who were vaccinated for the first time in their life only 29/86 (33.7%, CI: 23.7-43.7%) completed the recommended two-dose schedule. In conclusion, the importance of vaccinating children against influenza is hugely understated in Poland. General physicians should actively recommend annual influenza immunization of children. Recommendations of National Immunization Program concerning influenza vaccine should be clearer, simpler, and easier to implement.',\n",

       " 'INTRODUCTION: During the twentieth century, vaccination has been one of the measures of greatest public health impact. Vaccine administration has helped reduce the burden of disease and mortality from infectious diseases. At present, there is increasing concern about infectious diseases and the ability of health systems to control them, highlighting the need for evaluation of vaccination programs. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of economic evaluation studies carried out regarding Spain on vaccines. METHODS: Systematic review. Search of articles in major bibliographic databases available online from January 1983 to June 2011. References identified were limited to full economic evaluations carried out regarding Spain that evaluated vaccination programs. For each of the selected papers, a set of predefined variables were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 46 studies met inclusion criteria. The topics studied were pneumococcal vaccination, influenza vaccination, Hepatitis B vaccination and varicella vaccination. Cost-minimization analysis, perspective of society, long time horizon, use of modeling techniques, and the inclusion of direct and indirect costs were the most common methodological characteristics. The results of the studies reviewed showed, in most cases, net savings or cost-effectiveness ratios below €30,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Although there has been an improvement in the methodological quality of studies, they still show shortcomings that should be addressed. From a public health perspective, it would be relevant to evaluate vaccines targeted to major health problems in Spain, including all relevant costs and benefits. In order to obtain a more efficient use of health resources, economic evaluation methods should be applied more rigorously and results should be used consistently in decision-making processes.',\n",

       " 'OBJECTIVE: To determine whether it is safe to vaccinate pregnant or postpartum mares with a commercial modified-live virus vaccine against equine viral arteritis (EVA). Design-Randomized controlled study. Animals-73 mares and their foals. PROCEDURES: Mares were vaccinated during mid gestation, during late gestation, or 2 or 3 days after parturition with a commercial modified-live virus vaccine or were not vaccinated. Foaling outcomes were recorded, and serum, blood, milk, and nasopharyngeal samples were obtained. RESULTS: All mares vaccinated during mid gestation foaled without any problems; 21 of 22 mares in this group had antibody titers against EAV at the time of foaling. Of the 19 mares vaccinated during late gestation, 3 aborted; antibody titers against EAV were detected in 13 of 15 mares from which serum was obtained at the time of foaling. All postparturient vaccinates were seronegative at foaling; all of them seroconverted after vaccination. No adverse effects were detected in any of their foals. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: When faced with a substantial risk of natural exposure to EAV, it would appear to be safe to vaccinate healthy pregnant mares up to 3 months before foaling and during the immediate postpartum period. Vaccinating mares during the last 2 months of gestation was associated with a risk of abortion; this risk must be weighed against the much greater risk of widespread abortions in unprotected populations of pregnant mares naturally infected with EAV.',\n",

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using self-administered anonymous questionnaires from 1 July to 8 September 2020. The main outcome was willingness of participants, and any children or older individuals living with them, to receive future COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore potential factors associated with vaccination willingness. RESULTS: A total of 1071 participants were asked about their willingness to receive future COVID-19 vaccines, for themselves and at least 747 children and 375 older individuals (≥60\\u2009years old) living with them. The highest proportion of expected willingness to vaccinate was among participants (88.6%), followed by children (85.3%) and older individuals (84.0%). The main reasons for reluctance to vaccinate among 119 participants were doubts regarding vaccine safety (60.0%) and efficacy (28.8%).

       " 'This article summarises the various stages of the risk/benefit assessment of vaccination strategies. Establishing the awaited effectiveness of a vaccination strategy supposes to have an epidemiologic description of the disease to be prevented. The effectiveness of the vaccine strategy will be thus expressed in numbers of cases, hospitalizations or deaths avoided. The effectiveness can be direct, expressed as the reduction of the incidence of the infectious disease in the vaccinated subjects compared to unvaccinated subjects. It can also be indirect, the unvaccinated persons being protected by the suspension in circulation of the pathogenic agent, consecutive to the implementation of the vaccination campaign. The risks of vaccination related to the adverse effects detected during the clinical trials preceding marketing are well quantified, but other risks can occur after marketing: e.g., serious and unexpected adverse effects detected by vaccinovigilance systems, or risk of increase in the age of cases if the vaccination coverage is insufficient. The medico-economic evaluation forms a part of the risks/benefit assessment, by positioning the vaccine strategy comparatively with other interventions for health. Epidemiologic and vaccinovigilance informations must be updated very regularly, which underlines the need for having an operational and reliable real time monitoring system to accompany the vaccination strategies. Lastly, in the context of uncertainty which often accompanies the risks/benefit assessments, it is important that an adapted communication towards the public and the doctors is planned.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Despite long-standing recommendations to vaccinate children who have underlying chronic medical conditions or who are contacts of high-risk persons, vaccination coverage among school-age children remains low. Community studies have indicated that school-age children have the highest incidence of influenza and are an important source of amplifying and sustaining community transmission that affects all age groups. METHODS: A consultation to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a universal recommendation for annual influenza vaccination of all children age ≥6 months was held in Atlanta, Georgia, in September 2007. Consultants provided summaries of current data on vaccine effectiveness, safety, supply, successful program implementation, and economics studies and discussed challenges associated with continuing a risk- and contact-based vaccination strategy compared with a universal vaccination recommendation. RESULTS: Consultants noted that school-age children had a substantial illness burden caused by influenza, that vaccine was safe and effective for children aged 6 months through 18 years, and that evidence suggested that vaccinating school-age children would provide benefits to both the vaccinated children and their unvaccinated household and community contacts. However, implementation of an annual recommendation for all school-age children would pose major challenges to parents, medical providers and health care systems. Alternative vaccination venues were needed, and of these school-located vaccination programs might offer the most promise as an alternative vaccination site for school-age children. CONCLUSIONS: Expansion of recommendations to include all school-age children will require additional development of an infrastructure to support implementation and methods to adequately evaluate impact.',\n",
       " \"INTRODUCTION: Vaccines are vital to reducing childhood mortality, and prevent an estimated 2 to 3\\xa0million deaths annually which disproportionately occur in the developing world. Overall vaccine coverage is typically used as a metric to evaluate the adequacy of vaccine program performance, though it does not account for untimely administration, which may unnecessarily prolong children's susceptibility to disease. This study explored a hypothesized positive association between increasing vaccine hesitancy and untimeliness of immunizations administered under the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey employed a multistage sampling design, randomly selecting one health center within five sub-cities of Addis Ababa. Caregivers of 3 to 12-month-old infants completed a questionnaire on vaccine hesitancy, and their infants' vaccination cards were examined to assess timeliness of received vaccinations. RESULTS: The sample comprised 350 caregivers. Overall, 82.3% of the surveyed children received all recommended vaccines, although only 55.9% of these vaccinations were timely. Few caregivers (3.4%) reported ever hesitating and 3.7% reported ever refusing a vaccine for their child. Vaccine hesitancy significantly increased the odds of untimely vaccination (AOR 1.94, 95% CI: 1.02, 3.71) in the adjusted analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This study found high vaccine coverage among a sample of 350 young children in Addis Ababa, though only half received all recommended vaccines on time. High vaccine hesitancy was strongly associated with infants' untimely vaccination, indicating that increased efforts to educate community members and providers about vaccines may have a beneficial impact on vaccine timeliness in Addis Ababa.\",\n",

Although the recommended schedule in all age groups (children, adolescents and adults) is a single dose, physicians in some countries follow the 2007 recommendation of the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) which recommends \"implementation of a routine 2-dose varicella vaccination program for children, with the first dose administered at age 12--15 months and the second dose at age 4--6 years.\" ( 1) Therefore, cases can arise when two doses of Varicela Biken are given even though the ACIP guidelines are a response to the US epidemiological situation and for US licensed products based on the Oka/Merck and the Oka-RIT strains (Varicela Biken is not registered in US). The aim of this study is to ascertain the safety of a second dose of Varicela Biken in children who have been previously vaccinated with the same vaccine. In this study, children, 4-6 years of age who had been previously vaccinated with Varicela Biken, received a single 0.5 mL dose of live attenuated varicella virus vaccine containing at least 1000 Plaque Forming Units (PFU) attenuated live Varicella-zoster virus (Oka strain). Participants were monitored for 30 minutes after vaccination. Predefined injection site and systemic reactions were solicited during the subsequent seven days. Unsolicited injection site reactions and unsolicited systemic events were collected throughout the study. Any serious adverse events occurring throughout the study were reported to the sponsor\\'s pharmacovigilance department. One hundred and twenty two children were recruited and all provided safety data. There were no immediate adverse events or injection site reactions. Forty three percent of participants reported injection site reactions and 22.1% reported systemic reactions on solicitation during the seven days after vaccination. During the 30 day monitoring period, 43 participants reported a total of 66 adverse events. Seven participants reported a total of eight unsolicited events that were assessed as related to the vaccine or where the relationship to vaccination was unknown. Five of these eight events were injection site reactions and all were mild, systemic reactions included mild rash (1 case) and fever (2 cases). There was a single serious adverse event that was not related to the study medication (subject was a passenger in a motor vehicle accident). A second dose of Varicela Biken was well tolerated and showed no significant safety issues in this population of previously vaccinated children.',\n",
       " 'Four groups of six cattle were vaccinated from two to five times at 6 month intervals with two different trivalent FMD vaccines licensed in the given year. The FMDV type A strains in the vaccines designated A5F and A5B were closely related. Three months after the last vaccination the cattle were challenged by contact with animals inoculated with the original field strain A5B. The inoculated animals developed typical FMD symptoms with vesicles in the mouth and on the feet. Those cattle which had received vaccines that did not contain strain A5B also became severely sick, even after five vaccinations. Animals vaccinated twice with type B containing vaccine were also not completely protected. A safe protection can obviously only be achieved for fairly short periods of time if vaccine and challenge strain are homologous. It is proposed to change the rules of licensing, to speed up the procedure to vaccinate in cases of outbreaks. The need for further research, especially into improving vaccines, is stressed.',\n",
       " \"OBJECTIVES: To identify predictors of: uptake of the childhood influenza vaccine in the 2015-2016 influenza season, parental perceptions of side-effects from the influenza vaccine and intention to vaccinate one's child for influenza in the 2016-2017 influenza season. DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey. SETTING: Data were collected in England shortly after the end of the 2015-2016 immunization campaign. PARTICIPANTS: 1001 parents or guardians of children aged between two and seven. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported uptake of the childhood influenza vaccine in the 2015-2016 influenza season, perception of side-effects from the influenza vaccine and intention to vaccinate one's child in the 2016-2017 influenza season. RESULTS: Self-reported uptake of the childhood influenza vaccine was 52.8%. Factors strongly positively associated with uptake included the child having previously been vaccinated against influenza, perceiving the vaccine to be effective and perceiving the child to be susceptible to flu. Factors strongly negatively associated with uptake included perceiving the vaccine to be unsafe, to cause short-term side-effects or long-term health problems and believing that yearly vaccination may overload the immune system. Predictors of intended vaccine uptake in 2016-2017 were similar. Participants who perceived side-effects after the 2015-2016 vaccination reported being less likely to vaccinate their child next year. Side-effects were more likely to be reported in first-born children, by participants who knew another child who had side-effects, those who thought that the vaccine would interact with medication that the child was currently taking, and those who believed the vaccine causes short-term side-effects. CONCLUSIONS: Perceptions about the childhood influenza vaccine show strong associations with uptake, intended uptake and perception of side-effects. Attempts to improve uptake rates from their current low levels must address these perceptions.\",\n",

Again, BCG vaccination is not generally recommended and should be given only to individuals at high risk of contracting the disease. It is therefore not listed any more in the general recommendations (A) but only mentioned under special vaccinations (B). Special indications for BCG vaccination were clearly reformulated. Vaccinations against diphtheria-tetanus or pertussis-diphtheria-tetanus are recommended as usual, an oral pertussis vaccine is presently not available and an acellular pertussis vaccine is under study.

       " 'Vaccinations of healthcare workers (HCWs) aim to directly protect them from occupational acquisition of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) and to indirectly protect their patients and the essential healthcare infrastructure. However, outbreaks due to VPDs continue to challenge healthcare facilities and HCWs are frequently traced as sources of VPDs to vulnerable patients. In addition, HCWs were disproportionately affected during the current measles outbreak in Europe. Areas covered: We reviewed the recent published information about HCWs vaccinations with a focus on mandatory vaccination policies. Expert commentary: Although many countries have vaccination programs specifically for HCWs, their vaccination coverage remains suboptimal and a significant proportion of them remains susceptible to VPDs. The increasing vaccination hesitancy among HCWs is of concern, given their role as trusted sources of information about vaccines. Mandatory vaccinations for HCWs are implemented for specific VPDs in few countries. Mandatory influenza vaccination of HCWs was introduced in the United States a decade ago with excellent results. Mandatory vaccinations for VPDs that may cause significant morbidity and mortality should be considered. Issues of mistrust and misconceptions about vaccinations should also be addressed.',\n",

An additional 9 heifers served as nonvaccinated controls. Comparable groups of these animals were challenge exposed at 131 and 178 days after vaccination, using 1 X 10(8) B bovis organisms contained in freshly collected blood from a splenectomized calf with ascending parasitemia. Challenge exposure led to no deaths of vaccinated animals, whereas 4 of the control (nonvaccinated) animals died of disease.

       " 'BACKGROUND: A number of studies have described influenza vaccination coverage during pregnancy but few publications have described rates of other vaccinations. PURPOSE: To describe vaccination rates during pregnancy in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), with particular focus on vaccinations contraindicated during pregnancy. METHODS: Pregnancies ending in 2002 through 2009 and vaccinations administered during these pregnancies were identified in the VSD. Vaccination rates per 1000 pregnancies during the study period were calculated by vaccine type, recommendation category, pregnancy year, maternal age, and trimester. Analyses were conducted in 2012-2013. RESULTS: In the VSD, 669,695 pregnancies and 141,389 vaccinations were identified. Trivalent inactivated influenza (TIV) was the most commonly administered vaccination (174.1 doses per 1000 pregnancies) and was most often administered during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. The most common vaccines in the \"consider if indicated\" category were tetanus-diphtheria (6.1 per 1000) and hepatitis B (3.7 per 1000). Contraindicated vaccination was infrequent, and the majority of these were measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) (1.2 per 1000); varicella (1.0 per 1000); and live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) (0.3 per 1000). Both \"consider if indicated\" and contraindicated vaccines were more frequently administered during early pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: TIV was the most commonly administered vaccine. With the exception of TIV, other vaccines were most frequently administered during early pregnancy and among younger women, suggesting that vaccination may occur when the woman and/or provider are unaware of the pregnancy. Contraindicated vaccines were infrequently administered during pregnancy; however, given that some women received contraindicated vaccines later in pregnancy, clearer recommendations and improved provider education may be needed.',\n",
       " 'Recognition of the mucosal portal of entry for many infectious diseases and of the relevance of mucosal immune response to protection has encouraged the development of vaccines administered by mucosal routes, principally oral and intranasal, for stimulation of intestinal and nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissues respectively. The oral route is problematic in cattle and other ruminants where antigen degradation in the rumen is likely, prior to transit to the intestine. On the other hand, rumination can be exploited for exposure of nasopharyngeal tissues during cudding if vaccine antigen is expressed by a fibrous feed like alfalfa. An increase in anti-leukotoxin (Lkt) IgA was demonstrated in nasal secretions of calves following feeding of alfalfa expressing a truncated Lkt50 from Mannheimia haemolytica, and there is evidence suggesting that such vaccination may protect against experimentally induced pneumonia. Intranasal vaccination is an alternative approach for use in pre-ruminating calves. Intranasal administration of ISCOMs carrying soluble antigens of M. haemolytica, including native Lkt, induced Lkt specific IgA in nasal secretions after vaccination at 4 and 6 weeks of age. Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of the same vaccine induced Lkt specific IgG in both serum and nasal secretions, whereas s.c. administration of a commercial M. haemolytica vaccine did not. Regardless of the vaccination strategy employed it is difficult to assess the immunogenicity of mucosally administered vaccines because production of secreted antibodies tends to be transient, and they do not persist on the mucosal surface in the absence of ongoing antigenic stimulation. An additional challenge is demonstration of vaccine efficacy in response to experimental infection. Protection of the mucosally vaccinated animal will most probably result from recall response, which may not amplify sufficiently to counter the effects of experimental pulmonary delivery of a large bolus of virulent bacteria, even though the response would suffice over the more prolonged and gradual infection that occurs in natural induction of pneumonia.',\n",

       " 'Southeast (SE) Asia plays an important role in global food security as this region has been regarded as one of the major producers of aquaculture product and, to date, freshwater fish accounted for one-third of the total aquaculture in SE Asia. The intensification of freshwater farming corresponding to increase of consumer demands has inevitably led to the emergence and re-emergence of diseases causing tremendous economic loss in the region. Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus), the major freshwater fish species of SE Asia, have been reported susceptible to several bacterial pathogens, e.g. Streptococcus agalactiae, Edwardsiella ictalurid and Flavobacterium columnare. Since only a limited number of vaccines being registered and marketed, these pathogenic organisms still represent a severe threat to aquaculture industry in SE Asia. However, there is profound advancement in the understanding of disease epidemiology, pathogenic mechanisms, teleost mucosal immunity and vaccine delivery system over the last few years. This review aimed to summarize those recent findings which hopefully can provide novel insight into the future development of suitable vaccine and vaccination regime against bacterial infection in SE Asia region.',\n",
       " 'The purpose of this article is to look at the effect of the federal compensation scheme under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act on the people and institutions involved in the administration of vaccinations. More vaccine-injured children will probably receive compensation than would have been true under state law, but each child will probably receive less money for damages. Manufacturers will pay excise taxes to fund the compensation scheme and receive, in return, substantial immunity from liability under state law. Although these provisions create incentives that work in opposite directions, producers likely will still have reason to improve the safety and efficacy of vaccines. The situation for those who administer vaccinations is less clear. Freeing them from the threat of litigation would leave them with little incentive to use immunizations appropriately because they do not contribute to the compensation scheme. Although Congress intended to make those who give vaccines immune from state claims, it may have failed to do so, leaving providers with their liability largely unchanged. The most pervasive uncertainty is that the Act is designed to self-destruct and may soon return vaccine-injured children, manufacturers, and providers to the state of the law before Congress acted.',\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: Uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine among girls in the Dutch immunization program has plateaued at around 60%. Vaccinating boys may be an appealing complementary strategy for the prevention of HPV-related diseases, especially since tender negotiations and reduced dosing schemes have driven down the cost of vaccination. METHODS: We expanded a previously published Bayesian synthesis framework to account for all vaccine type-related cancers and herd immunity effects from vaccinating girls and boys. We evaluated the efficiency of vaccinating boys relative to increasing vaccine uptake among girls and assessed the cost-effectiveness of a sex-neutral program. RESULTS: Vaccinating 40% of boys along with 60% of girls yielded the same gain in life-years (LYs) as increasing the uptake in girls from 60% to 80%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of vaccinating boys was €9134/LY (95% credible interval [CrI], €7323/LY-€11231/LY) under 3% discounting. The ceiling vaccination costs at which the ICER remained below the per capita gross domestic product threshold was €240 (95% CrI, €200-€280) per vaccinated boy. If girls' uptake increased to 90%, the ceiling costs decreased to €70 (95% CrI, €40-€100) per vaccinated boy. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinating boys along with girls is only modestly less efficient than increasing uptake among girls and highly likely to be cost-effective under current vaccine costs and uptake in the Netherlands.\",\n",

Methods: In 2014, we selected 12 counties in Guangdong, Jiangsu, Chongqing, Jiangxi, Heilongjiang and Gansu provinces by using stratified cluster random sampling method and extract information of children born from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2012 from Children's Immunization Information System. We investigated ten children of each birth cohort in each county by checking the vaccination certification, and a total of 606 children were investigated. A survey was conducted to check the information of the children's vaccination certification with the data of Children's Immunization Information System by questionnaire including the basic information (province, county, name, gender, birth date, etc) and the rotavirus vaccination (vaccination date, dose, etc) to analyze the rotavirus vaccination situation. Results: 340 of 606 children were male. There were 121, 124, 122, 119 and 120 children born in 2008-2012, respectively. The proportions of the first and the second dose of rotavirus vaccination were 32.8% (199) and 9.7% (59). The proportion of the third dose of rotavirus vaccination among children born between 2008 and 2010 was 3.5% (13) since children born in 2011 and 2012 did not reach the age of third dose vaccination. The proportion of the first dose of rotavirus vaccination in high, middle and low per capita disposable income areas was 45.0% (91), 37.7% (77) and 15.5% (31) respectively (χ(2)= 43.15, P<0.001). Among 199 children vaccinated with the first dose of vaccine, the vaccination age mainly concentrated in 2 to 21 months, of which the peak was 5 to 13 months (66.8%, 133). The intervals between 2 doses of vaccination were mainly from 12 to 13 months (42.4%, 25) among the 59 children who received at least 2 doses of vaccine. In the 13 children vaccinated with 3 doses, the intervals between the second and the third dose were 12 months (5). Of the 271 doses of rotavirus vaccine vaccinated during 2008-2014, 34.7% (94 doses) were vaccinated in June-August, 88 were vaccinated simultaneously with 18 other vaccines, accounting for 32.5% of the total. Of the 18 other vaccines, inactivated vaccines such as diphtheria vaccine (30 doses), Hib vaccine (14 doses), group A meningitis vaccine (10 doses) were predominant. Conclusion: The proportion of rotavirus vaccination was low and the vaccination age was relatively late. The vaccination mode was different from the recommendation of WHO. It is recommended that routine immunization of rotavirus vaccines should be carried out in early-months of children.\",\n",

We aimed to determine whether information about herd immunity and local vaccination coverage could change an individual's vaccination plans and concern about influenza. METHODS: We surveyed Minnesota residents ≥18\\u202fyears during the 2016 Minnesota State Fair. Participants were asked to identify the definition of herd immunity, to report their history of and plans to receive influenza vaccine, to report their concern about influenza, and to estimate the reported influenza vaccination coverage in their county. After providing educational information about herd immunity and local vaccination rates, we reassessed vaccination plans and concerns. We used logistic regression to estimate predicted percentages for those willing to be vaccinated, for concern about influenza, and for changes in these outcomes after the intervention. We then compared those individuals with and without prior knowledge of herd immunity, accounting for other characteristics. RESULTS: Among 554 participants, the median age was 57\\u202fyears; most were female (65.9%), white (91.0%), and non-Hispanic/Latino (93.9%). Overall, 37.2% of participants did not know about herd immunity and 75.6% thought that the influenza vaccination coverage in their county was higher than it was reported. Those not knowledgeable about herd immunity were significantly less likely than those knowledgeable about the concept to report plans to be vaccinated at baseline (67.8% versus 78.9%; p\\u202f=\\u202f0.004). After learning about herd immunity and influenza vaccination coverage, the proportion of those not knowledgeable about herd immunity who were willing to be vaccinated increased significantly by 7.3 percentage points (p\\u202f=\\u202f0.001). Educating participants eliminated the significant difference in the proportion planning to be vaccinated between these two groups (80.1% of those knowledgeable and 75.1% of those who were not initially knowledgeable became willing; p\\u202f=\\u202f0.148). CONCLUSIONS: Education about herd immunity and local vaccination coverage could be a useful tool for increasing willingness to vaccinate, generating benefits both to individuals and communities.\",\n",

However, the existing pediatric immunization infrastructure does not have the capacity to vaccinate a high proportion of children each year. School-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) programs provide an opportunity to immunize large numbers of school-age children. We reviewed the medical literature in order to document the current U.S. experience to benefit future SLIV programs. Published reports or abstracts for 36 SLIV programs were identified, some of which spanned multiple years. The programs immunized between 70-128,228 students. While most programs vaccinated 40-50% of students, coverage ranged from 7-73%. Higher percentages of elementary students were vaccinated compared with middle and high school students. While many programs offered only intranasal vaccine, several programs have successfully used both the intranasal and injectable vaccines. Faculty and staff were immunized in some programs and uptake in this group varied considerably. Students were vaccinated quickly during school hours. Costs, where reported, ranged from approximately $20-$27 per dose delivered, including both vaccine and administration costs. The greatest need for future U.S. SLIV program implementation is the development of a financially sustainable model that can be replicated annually on a national scale.',\n",
       " \"Vaccines have much relevance and promise for improving adult health in the United States, but to date, overall use and uptake remain far below desired levels. Many adults have not received recommended vaccinations and many healthcare providers do not strongly and actively encourage their use with patients. This has led some public health and medical experts to conclude that adult vaccines are severely undervalued by the U.S. public and healthcare providers and to call for campaigns and communication-based efforts to foster increased appreciation, and in turn, higher adult immunization rates. A narrative integrative review that draws upon the vaccine valuation and health communication literatures is used to develop a framework to guide campaign and communication-based efforts to improve public, provider, and policymakers' assessment of the value of adult vaccination. The review does this by: (1) distinguishing social psychological value from economic value; (2) identifying the implications of social psychological value considerations for adult vaccination-related communication campaigns; and (3) using five core health communication considerations to illustrate how social psychological notions of value can be integrated into campaigns or communication that are intended to improve adult vaccination value perceptions and assessments, and in turn, motivate greater support for and uptake of recommended adult vaccines.\",\n",

       " \"Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are a large group of very heterogeneous diseases, and the impact of the available vaccines on children with IEMs may vary depending on the child's metabolic characteristics. The main aim of this review is to re-analyse the administration of vaccines to such children in the light of the most recent data. As a whole, these indicate that children with stable or slowly progressing IEMs can receive the recommended schedules of all of the recommended vaccinations. However, vaccines should be administered more cautiously to children with IEMs associated with a significant risk of morbidity and/or mortality with catabolic events: i.e. under strict medical supervision, and only when the children are clinically well and their metabolic condition is acceptably controlled. Furthermore, a number of IEMs have been associated with immune deficiency although, in most cases, the immunological abnormalities disappear or are significantly reduced when the metabolic defect is corrected. The response to vaccines is therefore unpredictable, but it is reasonable to think that it may be inadequate in children with the most severe immune defects. In addition to defective protection, vaccines administered to children with IEM and severe immunodeficiency can actually cause the disease they were meant to prevent. This explains why experts suggest that vaccines based on live attenuated viruses should not be given to such children, although all of the other vaccines can be administered without limitation regardless of the type of immune defect. Nevertheless, only specific multicentre studies will make it possible to say when and how to use vaccines in children with different types of IEM in order to protect them from vaccine-preventable diseases without any risk of worsening their metabolic situation.\",\n",
       " 'Objective: Mass vaccination planning is occurring at all levels of government in advance of regulatory approval and manufacture of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for distribution sometime in 2021. We outline a methodology in which both health insurance provider network data and publicly available data sources can be used to identify and plan for SARS-CoV-2 vaccinator capacity at the county level. Methods: Sendero Health Plans, Inc. provider network data, Texas State Board of Pharmacy data, US Census Bureau data, and H1N1 monovalent vaccine data were utilized to identify providers with demonstrated capacity to vaccinate the population in Travis County, Texas to achieve an estimated SARS-CoV-2 herd immunity target of 67%. Results: Within the Sendero network, 2,356 non-pharmacy providers were identified with 788 (33.4%) practicing in primary care and 1,569 (66.6%) practicing as specialists. Of the total, 686 (29.1%) provided at least one immunization between January 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020. There are 300 pharmacies with active licenses in Travis County with 161 (53.7%) classified as community pharmacies.

Conclusion: A community-based health insurance plan can use data from its provider network and public data sources to support the CDC call to action to identify SARS-CoV-2 vaccinators in the community, including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and pharmacies in order to provide macro level estimates of SARS-CoV-2 administration and throughput.',\n",
       " \"Development of safe and effective vaccines is one the greatest medical triumphs. However, despite high immunization rates in the United States, 85% of health care providers (HCPs) will have a parent refuse a vaccine for his or her child each year. HCPs have the greatest influence on a parent's decision to vaccinate his or her child. To effectively communicate with vaccine-hesitant parents, HCPs must first understand the concerns of parents regarding immunization and understand influences that can lead to misinformation about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. HCPs should establish an open, nonconfrontational dialogue with vaccine-hesitant parents at an early stage and provide unambiguous, easily comprehensible answers about known vaccine adverse events and provide accurate information about vaccination. Personal stories and visual images of patients and parents affected by vaccine-preventable diseases and reports of disease outbreaks serve as useful reminders of the need to maintain high immunization rates. Ongoing dialogue including provider recommendations may successfully reassure vaccine-hesitant parents that immunization is the best and safest option for their child.\",\n",

At the Central Coast Public Health Unit, the authors sought to determine if follow-up of children said by the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR) to be overdue for vaccination improved both of these factors. In a quality improvement activity, monthly ACIR lists of overdue Central Coast children aged 9 to 10 months of age were examined. The study alternated three months of intervention with three months of no intervention. The intervention was designed to find evidence of vaccination, first from the last known provider, and then if this was unsuccessful, from the parent. If no information was available, a letter was sent to the parents. If the child was indeed vaccinated, the register was updated. If the child was missing any vaccinations, the parent(s) were encouraged to complete the schedule. On reviewing routinely-published quarterly ACIR data at three-monthly intervals for 24 months after the intervention (or non-intervention), timeliness of vaccination improved in the intervention cohort. Central Coast fully vaccinated rates diverged from NSW rates during the study. In addition, the ACIR quarters that contained two out of three months of intervention rather than one out of three months of intervention had the highest rates of fully vaccinated children.

       " 'Vaccines were first developed in England over 200 years ago and have made a significant positive impact on human society since. Not often realized is the intimate relationship shared between vaccines and women. Women were key to the initial development of vaccines; some were even advocating the concept of protection against infectious disease through prior asymptomatic infection (by variolation) before the publication of the report of the first successful smallpox vaccination in 1798. Since that milestone, women have been important partners in the development of vaccines and advocates for their widespread introduction. Modern vaccine development would not be possible without the altruistic informed consent granted by many women for the participation of themselves or their children in vaccine clinical trials all over the world. Vaccines have rewarded women handsomely in return. Individual women benefit in many ways ranging from safer pregnancies to preventing cancers to attractive, unblemished skin. Some vaccines are even specifically designed to prevent diseases primarily affecting women such as cervical cancer. Vaccines also have offered societal benefits to women. These include better maternal health and fostering an environment more amenable to effective family planning. With these advances, women become more empowered and have access to better economic opportunities. The challenge of meeting the millennium development goals specifically targeted for women will be facilitated by vaccines. A better realization by women of the benefits of this partnership secured over the past 200 years will enable them to reap fully the rewards of the future.',\n",

The meeting called for solution-oriented discussion toward improving current immunization levels, implementing the 2011 National Vaccine Advisory Committee adult immunization recommendations, and capitalizing on new opportunities to improve coverage. Provisions in the federal health reform law that increase access to preventive services, including immunizations, and the increasing numbers of complementary vaccine providers such as pharmacists, create new opportunities to increase access for immunization services and improve coverage for adults. The Summit organized around five focal areas: empowering providers, quality and performance measures, increasing access and collaboration, educating patients, and informing decision-makers. These focal areas formed the basis of working groups, charged to coordinate efforts by the participating organizations to address gaps in the current immunization system. Summit participants identified priority themes to address as tasks during the coming year, including better communicating the value of immunizations to increase demand for immunizations, creating a central repository of resources for providers, patients, and others interested in improving adult immunization levels, examining performance and quality measures and evaluating means to use such measures to motivate vaccine providers, increasing engagement with employer and employee groups to increase awareness and demand for vaccinations, improving the use of immunization information systems and electronic health reports, decreasing barriers to all vaccine providers including pharmacists and community vaccinators, decreasing the complexity of the adult vaccine schedule where possible, engaging adult immunization champions and leaders in key sectors, including adult healthcare provider groups, and encouraging more integration of immunization services with other preventive services.',\n",

This new strategy emphasizes vaccination of adolescents 11-12 years of age by establishing a routine visit to their health-care providers. Specifically, the purposes of this visit are to a) vaccinate adolescents who have not been previously vaccinated with varicella virus vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, or the second dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine; b) provide a booster dose of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids; c) administer other vaccines that may be recommended for certain adolescents; and d) provide other recommended preventive services. The recommendations for vaccination of adolescents are based on new or current information for each vaccine. The most recent recommendations from ACIP, AAP, AAFP, and AMA concerning specific vaccines and delivery of preventive services should be consulted for details (Exhibit 2).',\n",

       " 'Empirical testing of candidate vaccines has led to the successful development of a number of lifesaving vaccines. The advent of new tools to manipulate antigens and new methods and vectors for vaccine delivery has led to a veritable explosion of potential vaccine designs. As a result, selection of candidate vaccines suitable for large-scale efficacy testing has become more challenging. This is especially true for diseases such as dengue, HIV, and tuberculosis where there is no validated animal model or correlate of immune protection. Establishing guidelines for the selection of vaccine candidates for advanced testing has become a necessity. A number of factors could be considered in making these decisions, including, for example, safety in animal and human studies, immune profile, protection in animal studies, production processes with product quality and stability, availability of resources, and estimated cost of goods. The \"immune space template\" proposed here provides a standardized approach by which the quality, level, and durability of immune responses elicited in early human trials by a candidate vaccine can be described. The immune response profile will demonstrate if and how the candidate is unique relative to other candidates, especially those that have preceded it into efficacy testing and, thus, what new information concerning potential immune correlates could be learned from an efficacy trial. A thorough characterization of immune responses should also provide insight into a developer\\'s rationale for the vaccine\\'s proposed mechanism of action. HIV vaccine researchers plan to include this general approach in up-selecting candidates for the next large efficacy trial. This \"immune space\" approach may also be applicable to other vaccine development endeavors where correlates of vaccine-induced immune protection remain unknown.',\n",

       " 'Adult immunizations have dramatically improved the health of many Americans. In the United States, researchers have documented disparities in the utilization of adult vaccinations between whites and racial and ethnic minority populations. This article examines racial and ethnic attitudes regarding recommended adult vaccinations. METHODS: Four adult focus groups (N=22) were conducted in community churches in San Francisco, CA. Participants were either age-appropriate or had clinical indications to receive a strong recommendation for influenza and pneumococcal immunizations but had not been routinely immunized against influenza and had never been vaccinated against pneumococcal disease. Content analysis was used to analyze narrative data and identify emerging themes. RESULTS: Participants reported that they lacked information about the benefits or potential side effects of influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations and that their physicians were not routinely informing them of, or recommending, these vaccinations. Meanwhile, most participants expressed a willingness to be vaccinated against pneumococcal infection and influenza. All focus group participants felt that community churches were a potential venue for delivery of adult vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: Many adult racial and ethnic minorities have basic information regarding the influenza vaccine but lack sufficient information regarding the benefits of pneumococcal vaccinations. Physicians should provide information regarding adult vaccinations to all patients. On-site vaccination and vaccine education programs in community churches may be successful in increasing the utilization of adult vaccinations in unvaccinated church populations.',\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVES: To assess the immunogenicity of vaccines for infants and to investigate whether the incidence of reactogenicity is reduced after each immunisation dose using needles of varying lengths and gauges. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 18 general practices within two UK primary care trusts. PARTICIPANTS: 696 healthy infants vaccinated at 2, 3, and 4 months of age, with follow-up to 5 months of age. INTERVENTIONS: Combined diphtheria, tetanus, whole cell pertussis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine and a serogroup C meningococcal glycoconjugate vaccine administered using either a wide, long needle (23 gauge/0.6 mm diameter, 25 mm), a narrow, short needle (25 gauge/0.5 mm diameter, 16 mm), or a narrow, long needle (25 gauge, 25 mm). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Local and general reactions recorded by parents for three days after each dose; and diphtheria, tetanus, and H influenzae type b antibody concentrations and functional antibody against serogroup C Neisseria meningitidis 28-42 days after the third dose. RESULTS: Local reactions to diphtheria, tetanus, whole cell pertussis, H influenzae type b vaccinations decreased significantly with wide, long needles compared with narrow, short needles. At all three doses one less infant experienced local reactions at days 1, 2, or 3 for every six to eight vaccinated. Significantly fewer infants vaccinated with the long needle experienced severe local reactions. Non-inferiority of the immune response was shown using a wide, long needle rather than a narrow, short needle for serogroup C meningococcal glycoconjugate vaccine and for diphtheria but not for H influenzae type b or tetanus, although no evidence was found of a decrease. Little difference was found between needles of the same length but different gauges in local reaction or immune response. CONCLUSIONS: Long (25 mm) needles for infant immunisations can significantly reduce vaccine reactogenicity at each dose while achieving comparable immunogenicity to that of short (16 mm) needles.

       " 'This revision of the General Recommendations on Immunization updates the 1989 statement. Changes in the immunization schedule for infants and children include recommendations that the third dose of oral polio vaccine be administered routinely at 6 months of age rather than at age 15 months and that measles-mumps-rubella vaccine be administered routinely to all children at 12-15 months of age. Other updated or new sections include a) a listing of vaccines and other immunobiologics available in the United States by type and recommended routes, advice on the proper storage and handling of immunobiologics, a section on the recommended routes for administration of vaccines, and discussion of the use of jet injectors; b) revisions in the guidelines for spacing administration of immune globulin preparations and live virus vaccines, a discussion of vaccine interactions and recommendations for the simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines, a section on the interchangeability of vaccines from different manufacturers, and a discussion of hypersensitivity to vaccine components; c) a discussion of vaccination during pregnancy, a section on breast-feeding and vaccination, recommendations for the vaccination of premature infants, and updated schedules for immunizing infants and children (including recommendations for the use of Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccines); d) sections on the immunization of hemophiliacs and immunocompromised persons; e) discussion of the Standards for Pediatric Immunization Practices (including a new table of contraindications and precautions to vaccination), information on the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, and Vaccine Information Pamphlets; and f) guidelines for vaccinating persons without documentation of immunization, a section on vaccinations received outside the United States, and a section on reporting of vaccine-preventable diseases. These recommendations are based on information available before publishing and are not comprehensive for each vaccine. The most recent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for each specific vaccine should be consulted for more details.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The intensity, spread, and effects of public opinion about vaccines are growing as new modes of communication speed up information sharing, contributing to vaccine hesitancy, refusals, and disease outbreaks. We aimed to develop a new application of existing surveillance systems to detect and characterise early signs of vaccine issues. We also aimed to develop a typology of concerns and a way to assess the priority of each concern. METHODS: Following preliminary research by The Vaccine Confidence Project, media reports (eg, online articles, blogs, government reports) were obtained using the HealthMap automated data collection system, adapted to monitor online reports about vaccines, vaccination programmes, and vaccine-preventable diseases. Any reports that did not meet the inclusion criteria--any reference to a human vaccine or vaccination campaign or programme that was accessible online--were removed from analysis. Reports were manually analysed for content and categorised by concerns, vaccine, disease, location, and source of report, and overall positive or negative sentiment towards vaccines. They were then given a priority level depending on the seriousness of the reported event and time of event occurrence. We used descriptive statistics to analyse the data collected during a period of 1 year, after refinements to the search terms and processes had been made. FINDINGS: We analysed data from 10,380 reports (from 144 countries) obtained between May 1, 2011, and April 30, 2012. 7171 (69%) contained positive or neutral content and 3209 (31%) contained negative content. Of the negative reports, 1977 (24%) were associated with impacts on vaccine programmes and disease outbreaks; 1726 (21%) with beliefs, awareness, and perceptions; 1371 (16%) with vaccine safety; and 1336 (16%) with vaccine delivery programmes. We were able to disaggregate the data by country and vaccine type, and monitor evolution of events over time and location in specific regions where vaccine concerns were high. INTERPRETATION: Real-time monitoring and analysis of vaccine concerns over time and location could help immunisation programmes to tailor more effective and timely strategies to address specific public concerns.

       " 'Vaccines are one of the most important advances in medicine as a public health tool for the control of immunopreventable diseases. Occasionally, adverse reactions may occur. If a child has a reaction to a vaccine, it is likely to disrupt his immunization schedule with risks to himself and the community. This establishes the importance of correctly diagnosing a possible allergy and defining appropriate behavior. Allergic reactions to vaccines may be due to the immunogenic component, to the residual proteins in the manufacturing process and to antimicrobial agents, stabilizers, preservatives and any other element used in the manufacturing process. Vaccination should be a priority in the entire child population, so this document describes particular situations of allergic children to minimize the risk of immunizations and achieve safe vaccination.',\n",
       " 'In view of doubts as to the potency level required to obtain nearly 100% successful vaccinations with the glycerolated smallpox vaccine prepared by the Netherlands National Institute of Public Health, its dose-effect relationship was compared with that of a glycerolated lymph from the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, England. The potency was estimated from pock counts on the chorio-allantoic membrane of chick embryos and the effect was judged from the \"take\" rate obtained in the primary vaccination of soldiers, the data being subjected to probit analysis.The relationship observed between the number of pock-forming units and the percentage of successful primary vaccinations was nearly identical with the two vaccines. The 50% effective doses were found to be 1.3-1.4 x 10(6) PFU/ml and the 99% doses to be 4.1-4.3 x 10(7) PFU/ml.',\n",
       " 'The administration of vaccines is not usually recommended in pregnant women because of a fear of severe adverse events for the fetus. However, contraindication to vaccination applies only to vaccines based on live attenuated viruses for the theoretical possibility that they might infect the fetus. In contrast, the use of several inactivated vaccines is useful and recommended. As a result of the transplacental passage of antibodies, maternal immunization can reduce the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases that may occur in the first months of life before the start or completion of the suggested vaccination schedule. One of the best examples is vaccination against influenza that can protect pregnant women from a disease that can lead to hospitalization and death in a significantly higher number of cases than in the general population and can induce protective specific antibody levels as well as being effective in infants in the first months of life. Other examples are vaccinations against tetanus, pertussis, pneumococcal infections and Haemophilus influenzae type b infection. This review analyses the advantages and limitations of maternal immunization as revealed by experience and the main publications.',\n",

       " 'The introduction of new vaccines is accompanied by a variety of challenges. Among these, very important ones concern the questions whether the public is willing to accept and willing to purchase the vaccine. Here we discuss factors associated with these questions in the context of vaccines that are becoming available against dengue virus infection. We reviewed published studies available from PubMed and Embase, conducting a meta-analysis when possible and narrative review when the data did not qualify for meta-analysis. We found that attitude toward vaccination and socioeconomic level had significant associations with dengue vaccine acceptance. In addition, socioeconomic level, knowledge, attitude and practice regarding dengue fever, having personally experienced dengue fever and vaccine price were associated with willingness to pay for dengue vaccine. To improve acceptance and willingness to pay for dengue vaccine, well-designed introduction programs that address the associated factors in a context-specific manner are essential.',\n",
       " 'In 2014 the contribution of aquaculture to supply food for human consumption overtook wild-caught fish for the first time. Despite improvements in the aquaculture industry, it has been estimated that as much as 10% of all cultured aquatic animals are lost because of infectious diseases, amounting to >10 billion USD in losses annually on a global scale. Vaccination to prevent disease is used routinely in finfish aquaculture, especially for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), while in a limited capacity (or not at all) in many other fish species due to lack of vaccines, poor performance or cost. There has, nevertheless, been impressive progress in fish vaccine development over the last 4 decades with 24 licenced fish vaccines now commercially available for use in a variety of fish species. These comprise whole killed, peptide subunit, recombinant protein, DNA and live attenuated vaccines. Challenges do, however, still exist as the majority of commercial vaccines are killed whole cell pathogen preparations administered by intraperitoneal injection. This may not be the optimal route to deliver some vaccines, but lack of effective adjuvants and basic knowledge on immune response has hindered progress in the development of mucosal vaccines. The cost of injecting fish may also be prohibitive in some countries leading to disease treatment (e.g. with antibiotics) rather than using preventative measures. It is important that these issues are addressed as the industry continues to grow globally. Exciting opportunities exist for rapid development of fish vaccines in the future, with continued reduction in cost of technologies (e.g. of whole genome sequencing), regulations changing (e.g. DNA vaccines can now authorised in Europe), the introduction of novel antigen expression and delivery systems (such as virus-like particles, VLPs), development of novel adjuvants and advancements in the elucidation of basic mechanisms of mucosal immunity. Development of effective mucosal vaccines and optimisation of their delivery will facilitate novel vaccine development, and enable the aquaculture industries in LMIC to use vaccination routinely in the future. In addition, effective use of emergency (autogenous) vaccines will assist in tackling emerging disease challenges.',\n",
       " \"A pneumatic vaccinator has been successfully used to administer cell-associated turkey herpesvirus (HVT) vaccine without a loss in titer due to the pressure required to administer the vaccine. Laboratory studies have also shown that chickens vaccinated with graded doses of the HVT vaccine using doses as low as 41 PFU offered protection against Marek's disease (MD) when compared to the unvaccinated controls. The pneumatic vaccinator has also been successful in administering a combination of HVT vaccine and tissue culture fowl pox vaccine. Vaccinated birds were protected against challenge with virulent MD virus as well as fowl pox virus. Antibiotics such as spectinomycin pentahydrate or lincomycin hydrochloride monohydrate and spectinomycin sulfate tetrahydrate were used in combination with the HVT and fowl pox vaccine and none of the antibiotics appear to have an adverse effect on the efficacy of either vaccine.\",\n",
       " 'Understanding perceptions and characteristics of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinated and non-vaccinated girls can inform communication activities and vaccine delivery strategies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate knowledge and factors associated with HPV unvaccinated girls after five years of vaccination program implementation in Sicily, an Italian region with low vaccination coverage (<50.0%). A cross-sectional study was conducted through a questionnaire designed to assess knowledge and vaccination status of girls of 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000 birth cohorts. The sample consisted of 350 girls who attended three high schools. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine predictors of vaccine refusal. The survey sample of girls shows that the 43.1% were HPV unvaccinated. A significant increased risk of being unvaccinated originated from the belief that the vaccine was too new (AdjOR = 21.08, CI95% = 2.57-172.97) and that it may cause cervical cancer (AdjOR = 4.36, CI95% = 1.26-15.07), along with having friends as a source of information on the vaccine (AdjOR = 3.67, CI95% = 1.63-8.25). A significant inverse association was observed between being unvaccinated and having Pediatrician/General practitioner as a source of information on HPV vaccine (AdjOR = 0.40, CI95% = 0.24-0.68). Many girls lack the fundamental knowledge about the HPV vaccine. The key issue is the promotion and implementation of information programs to raise awareness of girls on the importance of the vaccine.',\n",

       " 'An overview on the short, only 200 years, past history and future expectations in the field of vaccines is presented. The focus is on development trends and potential rather than individual vaccines. While the first vaccines were a result of keen observation, the further development has been tightly dependent on the development of microbiology to provide both the knowledge basis and the technology for new vaccines for new purposes. The post-genomic era just starting therefore promises an exponential increase of vaccine research and new vaccines, both improved vaccines with a greater efficacy and less adverse effects to replace old ones and vaccines for prevention of diseases for which no vaccines exist. Furthermore, fully new applications to prevention or treatment of chronic diseases not traditionally associated with infections are expected.',\n",
       " 'Our study objective was to examine how maternal social support and depressive symptoms are associated with time to completion of childhood vaccinations. We used cross-sectional data from 582 randomly-selected, low-income Brazilian children. Adjusted Cox Proportional Hazard models were used to estimate time to completing the first three recommended oral polio and diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) vaccinations as well as their booster doses. Among only the women with low social support, each ten-point increase on the Medical Outcomes Study - Social Support Scale was associated with a 20% increased chance of completing the first three recommended vaccinations for polio and DPT at any given time (HR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.02-1.42). Although falling short of statistical significance, also among mothers with low social support, we found a suggestive finding of increased social support associated with 25% greater chance of completing polio and DPT booster vaccines at any given time (HR = 1.25, 95% CI 0.98-1.60). There was no association between maternal depressive symptoms and vaccination completion. Among mothers with little social support, increased social support may be important for timely completion of vaccinations in low-income Brazilian children. Longitudinal studies and research on mechanisms explaining associations between maternal social support and childhood vaccination are needed.',\n",

       " 'OBJECTIVES: Newcomers experience unique challenges with respect to vaccination. These challenges are compounded by the need to navigate complex vaccination catch-up schedules upon arrival in their new home countries. Our group has pioneered the development of CANImmunize, a free, bilingual, pan-Canadian digital application designed to empower individuals to manage their vaccination records. To inform how a vaccine tracking app such as CANImmunize might be tailored to meet the unique needs of newcomers, this study sought to determine commonly spoken languages, technology use, and current methods of vaccine tracking among recent newcomers to Canada. METHODS: Government-assisted refugees attending a health clinic in Ottawa, Canada were invited to complete a 17-question needs assessment survey. The survey captured data on household demographics, spoken languages, country of origin, technology use and methods used to track vaccination history. RESULTS: 50 newcomers completed the needs assessment survey. Arabic was the predominant language spoken by surveyed individuals. Although 92% of participants owned a smartphone, the majority did not actively use digital health applications. 18 (36%) participants reported being vaccinated before arriving in Canada. 27 (54%) participants were parents, 23 of whom reported that their children were vaccinated prior to arrival in Canada. 38 (76%) participants indicated that they would use a vaccine tracking app such as CANImmunize if it were translated into their primary language of communication. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study indicate that mobile technology may be a useful tool to help newcomer families stay on track with provincial and territorial immunization schedules.',\n",

Meningitis due to the serogroup A meningococcus, previously responsible for most epidemics, has fallen by 99% in vaccinated countries. Success must, however, not distract from the continuing burden of meningitis in this region of Africa. The number of all meningitis epidemics at health district level has fallen by 60% following vaccination, but epidemics due to other meningococcal serogroups continue and may be increasing. The introduction of low cost multivalent conjugate vaccines must be given high public health priority.',\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: While vaccines not covered by China's Expanded Program on Immunization can be received voluntarily with out-of-pocket payment, the uptake of self-paid vaccines in China is low. OBJECTIVE: To investigate willingness to pay (WTP) for self-paid vaccines and its determinants in China. METHODS: We interviewed 2160 randomly selected households with children 0-3 years old, in 108 communities from three provinces in 2013. A bidding game method was used to elicit WTP for two self-paid vaccines: 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and influenza vaccine. We conducted multivariate linear regressions to determine factors affecting the WTP. RESULTS: Median WTP for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and influenza vaccine were Chinese Yuan 200 and 60 (10 US Dollars). 92% and 55% of respondents, respectively were not willing to pay the market price for these two vaccines. Lower price barrier and higher ability to pay were associated with higher WTP. Those with better vaccine or disease-related knowledge, higher perceived vulnerability and severity of diseases were willing to pay more. However, perceived effectiveness and safety barriers to vaccination had no significant effects on the WTP. Recommendations from peers and healthcare providers increased the WTP. Fathers and grand parents of children had a higher WTP than their mothers. The WTP decreased with age, but was not affected by education and occupation. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of individuals, in our study, were not willing to pay the market price for self-paid vaccines against high-burden diseases in China. The economic barriers to vaccination should therefore be removed to increase the demand. Region-specific information about disease burden, fiscal capacity and cost-effectiveness is important for the development of local financing policy in order to cover vaccination costs. Interventions targeting psychosocial factors, such as health education and communication with providers and peers, could also be effective in increasing the uptake of these vaccinations.\",\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: following the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March 2020, countries started implementing strict control measures, health workers were re-deployed and health facilities re-purposed to assist COVID-19 control efforts. These measures, along with the public concerns of getting COVID-19, led to a decline in the utilization of regular health services including immunization. METHODS: we reviewed the administrative routine immunization data from 15 African countries for the period from January 2018 to June 2020 to analyze the trends in the monthly number of children vaccinated with specific antigens, and compare the changes in the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: thirteen of the 15 countries showed a decline in the monthly average number of vaccine doses provided, with 6 countries having more than 10% decline. Nine countries had a lower monthly mean of recipients of first dose measles vaccination in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the first quarter. Guinea, Nigeria, Ghana, Angola, Gabon, and South Sudan experienced a drop in the monthly number of children vaccinated for DPT3 and/or MCV1 of greater than 2 standard deviations at some point in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the mean for the months January-June of 2018 and 2019. CONCLUSION: countries with lower immunization coverage in the pre-COVID period experienced larger declines in the number of children vaccinated immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared. Prolonged and significant reduction in the number of children vaccinated poses a serious risk for outbreaks such as measles. Countries should monitor coverage trends at national and subnational levels, and undertake catch-up vaccination activities to ensure that children who have missed scheduled vaccines receive them at the earliest possible time.',\n",
       " 'Ever since the development of the first vaccine more than 200 years ago, vaccinations have greatly decreased the burden of infectious diseases worldwide, famously leading to the eradication of small pox and allowing the restriction of diseases such as polio, tetanus, diphtheria, and measles. A multitude of research efforts focuses on the improvement of established and the discovery of new vaccines such as the HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine in 2006. However, radical changes in the density, age distribution and traveling habits of the population worldwide as well as the changing climate favor the emergence of old and new pathogens that bear the risk of becoming pandemic threats. In recent years, the rapid spread of severe infections such as HIV, SARS, Ebola, and Zika have highlighted the dire need for global preparedness for pandemics, which necessitates the extremely rapid development and comprehensive distribution of vaccines against potentially previously unknown pathogens. What is more, the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria calls for new approaches to prevent infections. Given these changes, established methods for the identification of new vaccine candidates are no longer sufficient to ensure global protection. Hence, new vaccine technologies able to achieve rapid development as well as large scale production are of pivotal importance. This review will discuss viral vector and nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA and mRNA vaccines) as new approaches that might be able to tackle these challenges to global health.',\n",

DESIGN: A descriptive study of a crossover type (cross-sectional), with data-gathering by means of a self-administered questionnaire. SETTING: Primary Care teams (PCT) in Asturias Area III (Avilés county) and their referral hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 379 health workers (115 from PCT and 264 from the referral hospital) from Asturias Area III, with a simple random sample selection based on the Area's staff lists. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 34 of the subjects under study stated that they were immune prior to vaccination. Out of those without immunity, and therefore available for vaccination, 77.1% (80.9% doctors, 88.5% nurses and 57.7% auxiliary staff) accepted vaccination. There were no significant differences between PCT and hospital, except for auxiliary staff, for whom there were more vaccinations in the hospital. Doctors and nurses, independently of the work centre, were vaccinated to a significantly greater extent than the auxiliary staff. Among those who were not vaccinated, the main reason for refusing the vaccination was laziness or lack of interest (36.1% in PCT and 44.1% in hospital). CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis B vaccination in our areas is greater among health staff most exposed to risk of contagion. Despite the high vaccination rate, an important number of staff remain non-vaccinated, mainly because of their own lack of interest. This must be borne in mind when vaccination programmes are being designed.\",\n",

       " 'In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified the reduction in vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) as one of the greatest achievements of the previous decade. During that time, several new pediatric and adult vaccines were introduced including rotavirus, quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate, herpes zoster, human papillomavirus, pneumococcal conjugate, and adult tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis. Despite the impact of immunization and its public health priority, vaccine coverage among adults in the United States remains suboptimal. Incorporation of adult immunization into routine obstetric and gynecologic care may be one innovative approach to vaccinate women. Pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable period for VPD-associated complications for both mother and baby, as demonstrated by the influenza pandemic of 2009. In addition to preventing maternal and congenital disease, maternal immunization can also provide direct fetal/infant protection via passive immunity. This article summarizes vaccine classification, specific vaccines recommended during pregnancy/postpartum, and barriers to maternal immunization.',\n",

       " 'OBJECTIVE: Achieving universal influenza vaccination among children may necessitate collaborative delivery involving both practices and community vaccinators. We assessed among pediatricians nationally their preferences regarding location of influenza vaccination for patient subgroups and their attitudes about collaborative delivery methods. METHODS: The design/setting was a national survey conducted from July 2009 to October 2009. Participants included a representative sample of pediatricians from the American Academy of Pediatrics. RESULTS: The response rate was 79% (330 of 416). Physicians felt strongly that vaccination should occur in their practice for children with chronic conditions (52%) and healthy 6-24-month-old infants (48%), but few felt strongly about healthy 5-18-year-olds (17%). Most (78%) thought having multiple delivery sites increased vaccination rates, and 86% thought that influenza vaccine should be available at school. Physicians reported being very/somewhat willing to hold joint community clinics with public health entities (76%) and to suggest to patient subgroups that they receive vaccine at community sites, including public clinics or pharmacies (76%). The most frequently reported barriers to collaborative delivery with community sites or school-located delivery included concerns about the following: estimating the amount of vaccine to order if children are vaccinated elsewhere (community 56%; school 80%); transfer of vaccine records (community 57%; school 78%); and reluctance of families to go outside of the office (community 45%; school 74%). CONCLUSIONS: Most physicians are in favor of school-located or collaborative influenza vaccine delivery with community vaccinators, especially for healthy school-aged children. Collaborative approaches will require planning to ensure transfer of records, effective targeting of subgroups, and provisions to protect providers from being left with extra influenza supply.',\n",
       " 'In developing countries, immunization delivery would be more efficient, safer and economical if all vaccines could elicit long-term protection following needle-free administration of just a single dose and without need for a cold chain, and if immunization left an indelible (e.g., serologic) marker that would identify immunized persons. A few existing vaccines (e.g., yellow fever, measles) confer long-term protection following a single dose. To accomplish the same with less immunogenic live vaccines and with non-living antigens, potent (parenteral and mucosal) adjuvants are required. Emerging knowledge of how the innate immune system modulates adaptive immune responses is guiding development of modern adjuvants that can markedly enhance immune responses to vaccines by selective stimulation of components of the innate immune system. Needle-free immunization can be accomplished by administering vaccines via mucosal (oral or nasal) or transcutaneous routes or by parenteral injection using needle-free injection devices. Technologies such as vitrification (treatment with trehalose followed by drying) render vaccines resistant to temperature extremes. Ideally, immunization would lead to a biomarker such as a specific vaccine-derived antibody that allows differentiation of successfully immunized persons from susceptibles.',\n",
       " 'Vaccination is the most effective intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases in young children (1). Data from the 2016 National Immunization Survey-Child (NIS-Child) were used to assess coverage with recommended vaccines (2) among children aged 19-35 months in the United States. Coverage remained ≥90% for ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine (91.9%), ≥1 dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) (91.1%), ≥1 dose of varicella vaccine (90.6%), and ≥3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) (90.5%). Coverage in 2016 was approximately 1-2 percentage points lower than in 2015 for ≥3 doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP), ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine, the primary Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) series, ≥3 HepB doses, and ≥3 and ≥4 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), with no changes for other vaccines. More direct evaluation of trends by month and year of birth (3) found no change in coverage by age 2 years among children included in combined data from the 2015 and 2016 NIS-Child (born January 2012 through January 2015). The observed decreases in annual estimates might result from random differences in vaccination coverage by age 19 months between children sampled in 2016 and those sampled in 2015, among those birth cohorts eligible to be sampled in both survey years. For most vaccines, 2016 coverage was lower among non-Hispanic black* (black) children than among non-Hispanic white (white) children, and for children living below the federal poverty level(†) compared with those living at or above the poverty level. Vaccination coverage was generally lower among children insured by Medicaid (2.5-12.0 percentage points), and was much lower among uninsured children (12.4-24.9 percentage points), than among children with private insurance. The Vaccines for Children(§) (VFC) program was designed to increase access to vaccines among children who might not otherwise be vaccinated because of inability to pay. Greater awareness and facilitating use of VFC might be helpful in reducing these disparities. Efforts should also be focused on minimizing breaks in continuity of health insurance and eliminating missed opportunities to vaccinate children during visits to health care providers. Despite the observed disparities and small changes in coverage from 2015, vaccination coverage among children aged 19-35 months remained high and stable in 2016.',\n",
       " 'Over the past 15\\xa0y, several vaccines have been added to the recommended immunization schedule for adolescents in the United States. In addition to annual influenza vaccination, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap), meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY), and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for routine administration at ages 11-12\\xa0y, and a second dose of MenACWY at age 16. A vaccine against meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B (MenB) is also available and recommended for shared clinical decision-making. Though notable gains in uptake have been achieved for some adolescent vaccines, coverage varies considerably with lower rates for HPV vaccine and second dose of MenACWY. Coverage for MenB is especially low. While extensive research has focused on barriers to and solutions for higher uptake of HPV vaccine, limited attention has been given to the reasons for lower uptake of meningococcal vaccines among older adolescents. This purpose of this commentary is to discuss barriers to and solutions for higher uptake of meningococcal vaccines among older adolescents, and to identify gaps in knowledge that can inform research efforts going forward.',\n",
       " 'Vaccination status is more often evaluated by up-to-date vaccination coverage rather than timeliness of immunization. Delaying vaccination may be dangerous during infancy. The aim of this study was to identify the importance of potentially dangerous vaccination delay (previously defined) and determinants of these delays. We conducted a national, prospective, vaccination survey in June 2014, with primary care pediatricians. Children, 2 to 24\\xa0months of age, were included. Data about vaccination were extracted from their health books. Additional data were collected through a standardized questionnaire. Vaccine coverage rate and timeliness were calculated. Variables associated with a potentially dangerous vaccination delay as previously defined were determined by a multivariable analysis. Among the 443 included children (mean age 10.8\\xa0months, 49% males), 13% to 58% of vaccine doses according to vaccine type were done with a potentially dangerous delay. Globally, 47% of children had at least one potentially dangerous immunization delay. We identified two risk factors of potentially dangerous delayed immunization globally: an increasing age of the child (adjusted odds ratio: 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-1.3, p < 10(-3)), and a working mother (adjusted OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.2-4.7, p = 0.01). Despite a good vaccine coverage rate, a large number of children had a potentially dangerous vaccination delay. A high level of vigilance regarding these immunization delays, and particularly to the patients sharing the risk factors of immunization delay identified here, can increase quality and effectiveness of the vaccine protection.',\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: Thanks to a successful voluntary vaccination programme, measles, mumps and rubella are rare diseases in Sweden. Coverage among children 18 mo of age has been 99%, but the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination (MMR) has increasingly been questioned among parents. AIM: To study reasons why parents choose not to vaccinate their child against measles, mumps and rubella, and their opinions on vaccines and the diseases themselves. A secondary objective was to compare coverage at 18 mo of age based on parental report with the national statistics based on patient charts. METHODS: The official statistics were compared with patient charts for two birth cohorts in the city of Göteborg, Sweden. Out of these children born in 1995 and 1996, 300 unvaccinated and vaccinated children were identified. Their parents received a postal questionnaire assessing the parent's views on vaccines and childhood diseases. RESULTS: The documented vaccine coverage in this study was higher in 1995 and 1996 than official statistics indicated. The major reason, for both groups, for accepting respectively declining vaccination was strengthening the child's immune system. Parents with children unvaccinated against MMR were also more likely to have declined vaccination against diphtheria, polio, tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae and pertussis. One-third of the parents with a child unvaccinated against MMR had not yet made their final decision 3 y after the vaccine offer. Few parents, both with vaccinated and unvaccinated children, had acquired vaccine information from the Internet. Both groups believed that insufficient time was allocated for vaccine information and discussion at the Child Health Centre. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that official statistics on MMR vaccination uptake underestimate the number of vaccinated children. Vaccine safety is a major concern for many parents and needs to be addressed by healthcare professionals at institutions offering paediatric vaccinations.\",\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: Since 2006, the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been routinely recommended for preadolescent and adolescent girls in the United States. Depending on uptake patterns, HPV vaccine could reduce existing disparities in cervical cancer. METHODS: HPV vaccination status and reasons for not vaccinating were assessed using data from the 2008 National Health Interview Survey. Households with a girl aged 9-17 years were included (N = 2205). Sociodemographic factors and health behaviors associated with vaccine uptake were assessed using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 2.8% of 9- to 10-year-olds, 14.7% of 11- to 12-year-olds, and 25.4% of 13- to 17-year-olds received at least 1 dose of HPV vaccine; 5.5% of 11- to 12-year-olds and 10.7% of 13- to 17-year-olds received all 3 doses. Factors associated with higher uptake in multivariate analysis included less than high school parental education, well-child check and influenza shot in the past year, and parental familiarity with HPV vaccine. Parents' primary reasons for not vaccinating were beliefs that their daughters did not need vaccination, that their daughters were not sexually active, or had insufficient vaccine knowledge. More parents with private insurance (58.0%) than public (39.8%) or no insurance (39.5%) would pay $360-$500 to vaccinate their daughters. CONCLUSIONS: Less than one quarter of girls aged 9-17 years had initiated HPV vaccination by the end of 2008. Efforts to increase HPV uptake should focus on girls in the target age group, encourage providers to educate parents, and promote access to reduced-cost vaccines.\",\n",
       " \"Vaccination coverage among adults remains low in the United States. Understanding the barriers to provision of adult vaccination is an important step to increasing vaccination coverage and improving public health. To better understand financial factors that may affect practice decisions about adult vaccination, this study sought to understand how costs compared with payments for adult vaccinations in a sample of U.S. physician practices. We recruited a convenience sample of 19 practices in nine states in 2017. We conducted a time-motion study to assess the time costs of vaccination activities and conducted a survey of practice managers to assess materials, management, and dose costs and payments for vaccination. We received complete cost and payment data from 13 of the 19 practices. We calculated annual income from vaccination services by comparing estimated costs with payments received for vaccine doses and vaccine administration. Median annual total income from vaccination services was $90,343 at family medicine practices (range: $3968-$249,628), $28,267 at internal medicine practices (-$32,659-$141,034) and $2886 at obstetrics and gynecology practices (-$73,451-$23,820). Adult vaccination was profitable at the median of our sample, but there is wide variation in profitability due to differences in costs and payment rates across practices. This study provides evidence on the financial viability of adult vaccination and supports actions for improving financial viability. These results can help inform practices' decisions whether to provide adult vaccines and contribute to keeping adults up-to-date with the recommended vaccination schedule.\",\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVE: To compare antibody responses, feedlot morbidity and mortality rates, feedlot performance, and carcass value for calves vaccinated with 1 of 2 vaccination strategies and for unvaccinated control calves. DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial. ANIMALS: 451 beef steers and heifers. PROCEDURES: Calves were vaccinated with a modified-live infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV), bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 (BVDV1) and 2 (BVDV2), parainfluenza type 3 virus, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus vaccine and Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida bacterin-toxoid at approximately 67 and 190 days of age (group 1; n = 151) or at approximately 167 and 190 days of age (group 2; 150) or were not vaccinated (control; 150). Serum antibody titers were measured at approximately 2, 67, 167, 190, and 232 days of age. Morbidity and mortality rates, feedlot performance, and carcass value were recorded for 361 calves shipped to feedlots. RESULTS: Percentages of calves seroconverting to IBRV, BVDV1, and BVDV2 were significantly higher for groups 1 and 2 than for the control group. Mean treatment costs were significantly lower for vaccinated than for control calves, and mean mortality rate was significantly higher for control calves than for group 1 calves. Feedlot performance and carcass value did not vary significantly among groups. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggested that vaccination of beef calves with a 5-antigen modified-live virus vaccine at 67 and 190 days of age was as effective in terms of immunologic responses as was vaccination at 167 and 190 days of age.',\n",

One consequence is that we are accumulating steadily more experience of both the scientific and the ethical requirements of conducting vaccine trials in people. Good science is itself an ethical requirement, as it is meaningless to apply ethical principles to a scientifically flawed product or plan. Bad science can only be bad ethics. And we have learned that ethical principles are a necessity when we apply the benefits of science to the improving of human health. Recent epidemics have provided opportunities to expand our understanding of this field and of the many components of it that we recognize to be necessary to the ethical assessment of vaccines.\",\n",
       " \"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate progress in timely vaccination coverage associated with low-income households. DESIGN: The US National Immunization Survey. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 19 to 35 months living in low-income households who were sampled between 1995 and 2007 (N = 232 318). Low-income households had an annual income that was 133% or less of the federal poverty level, and high-income households had an annual income of 400% or more of the federal poverty level. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Administration of 4 or more doses of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTaP-DTP) vaccine; 3 or more doses of polio; 1 or more doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR); 3 or more doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib); 3 or more doses of hepatitis B; and 1 or more doses of varicella vaccines by age 19 months as reported by the children's vaccination providers. Progress in timely coverage was evaluated by tracking changes between consecutive annual birth cohorts born between 1994 and 2004. RESULTS: Among low-income children, timely vaccination coverage increased significantly between consecutive birth cohorts by an estimated 0.5% for DTaP-DTP, 0.3% for polio, 0.6% for MMR, 1.2% for hepatitis B, and 5.3% for varicella vaccines but did not change significantly for the Hib vaccine. Disparities in timely coverage for low- vs high-income children declined significantly between consecutive birth cohorts by an estimated -0.3% for MMR, -0.3% for hepatitis B, and -0.5% for varicella vaccines, did not change significantly for the polio vaccine, and increased significantly by 0.4% for the DTaP-DTP vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in vaccination coverage associated with low household income persist. Further progress in timely vaccination may be achieved by improving health care providers' reminder/recall systems, implementing educational interventions that address barriers to vaccination, and increasing parents' awareness of the Vaccines for Children Program.\",\n",

Vaccination coverage for each vaccine dose and completeness of different vaccine series were calculated by birth cohort, immigration status, and geographic area. The timeliness of vaccine doses scheduled before 12\\xa0months of age for the 2016 birth cohort was also examined Results: Coverage of all the vaccine doses scheduled before 12\\xa0months of age and its completeness reached the target goal of 90%. The coverage and completeness decreased substantially in vaccinations scheduled after 12\\xa0months old, and most of them were below 90%. The coverage and timeliness estimates of migrant children was lower than those of resident children and the coverage of WenZhou (WZ), Zhoushan (ZS) and Lishui (LS) was lower than other cities across all the birth cohorts. Despite high coverage rates for all antigens by age 12\\xa0months, there was a very large range of percent of vaccination delay when comparing different antigens scheduled in the first year of life for the 2016 birth cohort. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the success and improvement of immunization program in Zhejiang province, and identified some challenges. Strategies such as assessment, feedback, incentives, and exchange program, reminder/recall activity, home visits, immunization requirement for school's enrollment could be used to reach a higher coverage of the population.\",\n",
       " \"INTRODUCTION: To describe adolescents' perspectives regarding the use of school-located immunization programs (SLIP) for influenza vaccination. More importantly, adolescents were asked what factors would make them more or less likely to use a SLIP offering influenza vaccine. RESULTS: Participants were generally found to be knowledgeable about influenza and to have positive attitudes toward receiving the vaccine via SLIP. Students were more willing to participate in a SLIP if it were low cost or free, less time-consuming than going to a doctor, and if they felt they could trust vaccinators. Overall, high school and middle school students ranked the benefits of SLIP similarly to each other. METHODS: Focus groups using nominal group method were conducted with middle and high school students in a large, urban school district. Responses were recorded by each school, and then, responses were ranked across all participating schools for each question. CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of issues are important to middle and high school students when considering participation in SLIPs including convenience, public health benefits, trust in the program, program safety, and sanitary issues. Further research will be needed regarding the generalizability of these findings to larger populations of students.\",\n",

       " 'Immunological and serological changes that occur during pregnancy can alter the susceptibility of both the mother and the fetus against various infectious diseases. The pregnant woman has an altered immune response and, for some pathologies, is at increased risk of infection and of developing complications and serious outcomes. In addition, maternal infections can result in congenital anomalies, malformations or severe neonatal diseases. Vaccination of pregnant women can therefore have a double goal: to protect the mother from diseases that could have an impact on her health and to avoid infection/disease transmission to the fetus or the newborn. Despite the potential benefits of immunization in pregnant women, it is still evident reluctance and/or refusal of vaccinations by health professionals as well as by pregnant women, who are wary of the real advantages linked to vaccines. For these reasons a group of experts has evaluated the latest scientific evidence reported in the international literature on this relevant topic.',\n",

Use of combination vaccines reduces the number of injections per visit; however, there is limited evidence quantifying the effect of combination vaccines on vaccination rates. To examine how combination vaccines impact childhood completion (receipt of recommended doses) and compliance (receipt of age-appropriate vaccinations) rates, this study analyzed vaccination data from the 2012 National Immunization Survey (NIS), a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of caregivers of children aged 24 to 35\\xa0months in the United States. Vaccines were categorized as combination or single antigen. Vaccine completion was measured at ages 8, 18, and 24\\xa0months. Vaccine compliance and time undervaccinated were measured at 24\\xa0months.

In 1990, the peak of the resurgence, the incidence of measles among children aged less than 5 years was 15-fold higher than the median 1981-1988 incidence (4.8 per 100,000) (1). During 1991, approximately 9500 cases were reported (Figure 1), including 4662 cases among children aged less than 5 years (CDC, unpublished data). The measles epidemic is a consequence primarily of the failure to vaccinate preschool-aged children at appropriate ages (2); among children aged 16-59 months who developed measles during this resurgence, only 15% had received measles vaccine as recommended (CDC, unpublished data). This report compares the number of public clinic vaccinations* (i.e., all measles-containing vaccines [MCV], diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine [DTP], and oral polio vaccine [OPV]) for 1988 with that for 1989-1991 in response to the measles resurgence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",

       " 'In Sweden, a two-dose programme of vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) was introduced in 1982 and the target groups were children aged 18 months and 12 years. In 1993 the first age group of 12-year-olds that were vaccinated with MMR at 18 months will appear. The majority of the 12-year-old vaccines for many years, however, had already been vaccinated against measles and the MMR measles component was thus a booster dose. As the benefit of a booster dose against measles has been questioned, this was studied in a group of 163 12-year-old children, 122 of whom had been vaccinated against measles as young children. Of the 41 unvaccinated children, 23 had a history of clinical measles. The mean neutralizing titre level of the earlier vaccinated children, prior to the booster, was lower than that of the naturally immune children (reciprocal titre level 8 versus 20). After the booster the corresponding titre levels were 13 and 23. Among the seronegative children receiving their first dose, this figure amounted to 14. A moderate rise in titre was seen in those with low prevaccination titres. As the antibody protection afforded by vaccination was slightly lower than that of natural infection, even after a booster, follow-up studies must be recommended to evaluate the long-term protection of both a single and a two-dose programme.',\n",

       " 'OBJECTIVE: To determine the most rational strategy of vaccination with Candid 1 vaccine in order to prevent Argentine hemorrhagic fever among children under 15 years old living an endemic area. METHODS: To analyze the estimated effectiveness, a decision tree model was designed, with two possible options: vaccinate all the children under age 15 in the endemic area (\"expanded vaccination\") or vaccinate only the children at greater risk (\"selective vaccination\"). These two options were compared with the alternative of not vaccinating. The evaluation was complemented with a sensitivity analysis to identify the threshold values of the critical variables that could change the decision. The probabilities that were used were taken from earlier clinical and epidemiological trials. RESULTS: According to the model that we used, the expanded vaccination strategy was the best option, with a total expected utility of 9.99998 (out of a maximum possible 10.0). The sensitivity analysis showed that selective vaccination would be the best strategy if the incidence in the population with low risk drops to less than 3 per 1,000,000 population or if the rate of serious adverse reactions to the vaccine reaches more than 9 per 100,000 inhabitants. No variation in the parameters used in the model supported the option of not vaccinating. CONCLUSIONS: Given the risk and benefit parameters that we used, we recommend vaccinating with Candid 1 all the children under age 15 who live in the area endemic for Argentine hemorrhagic fever. The proposed model can be fitted to future needs, and it can help in decision-making by incorporating prospective disease surveillance data. These results can be used as a basis for cost and efficacy studies and for other quantitative analyses.',\n",

       " 'Non-specific effects of vaccination may be different for boys and girls. Due to the sequential administration of vaccines, it is difficult to separate the effect of different vaccines. We tested sex-specific effects of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTP) and polio vaccines and measles vaccines during the recent war (1998) in Guinea-Bissau when there was no functioning immunisation programme in the country. The study included 1491 children aged 1-17 months in four urban districts in Bissau. Vaccination status had been assessed in the study area in the 3 months before the war. The effect of DTP and polio vaccines was assessed for children who had not received measles vaccine. The effect of measles vaccine was evaluated for children aged 6-17 months. Compared with measles-unvaccinated children, measles-vaccinated children had lower mortality (mortality ratio (MR)=0.44 (95% CI 0.20-1.00)), the difference being marked for girls (0.25 (0.09-0.71)) but not for boys (0.84 (0.26-2.75)) (test of homogeneity, P=0.095). If measles cases were censored in the analysis, the mortality ratio for vaccinated and unvaccinated children was 0.38 (0.16-0.89). DTP and polio-vaccinated children did not have lower mortality than unvaccinated children. The female-male mortality ratio for DTP and polio-vaccinated children was 3.08 (1.11-8.56) and 0.63 (0.28-1.40) for measles-vaccinated children, a significant inversion of the ratios (test of homogeneity, P=0.013). The divergent female-male mortality ratios are unlikely to be explained by a selection bias going in different directions for different vaccines. The reduction associated with measles vaccination was unrelated to prevention against measles infection. Non-specific effects of vaccination should be assessed separately for boys and girls. Taking these effects into consideration may have implications for child mortality patterns in developing countries.',\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: Vaccine regulation in China meets World Health Organization standards, but China's vaccine industry and immunization program have some characteristics that differ from other countries. We described the history, classification, supply and prices of vaccines available and used in China, compared with high-and middle-incomes countries to illustrate the development of Chinese vaccine industry and immunization program. METHODS: Immunization policy documents were obtained from the State Council and the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC). Numbers of doses of vaccines released in China were obtained from the Biologicals Lot Release Program of the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC). Vaccine prices were obtained from Chinese Central Government Procurement (CCGP). International data were collected from US CDC, Public Health England, European CDC, WHO, and UNICEF. RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2015, the annual supply of vaccines in China ranged between 666 million and 1,190 million doses, with most doses produced domestically. The government's Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) prevents 12 vaccine preventable diseases (VPD) through routine immunization. China produces vaccines that are in common use globally; however, the number of routinely-prevented diseases is fewer than in high- and middle-income countries. Contract prices for program (EPI) vaccines ranged from 0.1 to 5.7 US dollars per dose - similar to UNICEF prices. Contract prices for private-market vaccines ranged from 2.4 to 102.9 US dollars per dose - often higher than prices for comparable US, European, and UNICEF vaccines. CONCLUSION: China is a well-regulated producer of vaccines, but some vaccines that are important globally are not included in China's EPI system in China. Sustained and coordinated effort will be required to bring Chinese vaccine industry and EPI into an era of global leadership.\",\n",

       " 'OBJECTIVE: To present an inventory of notifications of serious local reactions after revaccination of 4-year-old children with DaPT-IPV (diphtheria vaccine, acellular pertussis vaccine, tetanus vaccine and poliomyelitis vaccine), who had been vaccinated as a toddler with whole-cell pertussis combination vaccine (DwPT-IPV-Hib) and/or (from 2005 onward) with the acellular pertussis combination vaccine (DaPT-IPV-Hib). DESIGN: Descriptive inventory METHOD: Via an enhanced passive surveillance system professionals and private individuals can report an adverse event following vaccination within the Dutch national vaccination programme. The number of notifications of local side effects was related to the total number of vaccinated children registered in Praeventis, a national vaccination register in which information on an individual level is available. RESULTS: In 2008, we received an increasing number of notifications of serious local reactions after the revaccination of 4-year-olds with acellular DPT-IPV (average 3 per 1000 vaccinated children) with a peak in October/November. These children had also been vaccinated with acellular pertussis vaccine as infants. The symptoms of swelling and redness of sometimes the entire upper arm arose mostly the day after the vaccination and disappeared within 4 to 5 days without sequelae. CONCLUSION: Although the mechanisms underlying these serious local reactions are still not well understood, they do not imply an acute allergic reaction or infection and so medication against such reactions is not usually necessary.',\n",

       " \"INTRODUCTION: Expanded programme on immunizations in resource-limited settings currently measure vaccination coverage defined as the proportion of children aged 12-23 months that have completed their vaccination. However, this indicator does not address the important question of when the scheduled vaccines were administered. We assessed the determinants of timely immunization to help the national EPI program manage vaccine-preventable diseases and impact positively on child survival in Senegal. METHODS: Vaccination data were obtained from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) carried out across the 14 regions in the country. Children were aged between 12-23 months. The assessment of vaccination coverage was done with the health card and/or by the mother's recall of the vaccination act. For each vaccine, an assessment of delay in age-appropriate vaccination was done following WHO recommendations. Additionally, Kaplan-Meier survival function was used to estimate the proportion vaccinated by age and cox-proportional hazards models were used to examine risk factors for delays. RESULTS: A total of 2444 living children between 12-23 months of age were included in the analysis. The country vaccination was below the WHO recommended coverage level and, there was a gap in timeliness of children immunization. While BCG vaccine uptake was over 95%, coverage decreased with increasing number of Pentavalent vaccine doses (Penta 1: 95.6%, Penta 2: 93.5%: Penta 3: 89.2%). Median delay for BCG was 1.7 weeks. For polio at birth, the median delay was 5 days; all other vaccine doses had median delays of 2-4 weeks. For Penta 1 and Penta 3, 23.5% and 15.7% were given late respectively. A quarter of measles vaccines were not administered or were scheduled after the recommended age. Vaccinations that were not administered within the recommended age ranges were associated with mothers' poor education level, multiple siblings, low socio-economic status and living in rural areas. CONCLUSION: A significant delay in receipt of infant vaccines is found in Senegal while vaccine coverage is suboptimal.

Vaccine hesitancy is a continuum between vaccine acceptance and refusal. A growing number of people in Africa are delaying or refusing recommended vaccines for themselves or their children, even when safe and effective vaccines are available. This predisposes communities to infectious diseases, resulting in multiple disease outbreaks, ultimately consuming resources and costing lives. Vaccine hesitancy is currently receiving unprecedented global attention, however, there remains several knowledge gaps, particularly in Africa. The vast majority of research on this topic has been conducted in high income countries. Little is therefore known about the nature and causes of vaccine hesitancy in Africa, and evidence-based interventions in the region to address it are also limited. Moreover, tools to measure vaccine hesitancy are scarce, and none that exist have been validated in Africa. We discuss these knowledge gaps, and propose a research and capacity building agenda to better measure and overcome vaccine hesitancy in Africa. Ultimately, this is essential if we hope to enhance and sustain public demand for vaccination and preserve the tremendous achievements of vaccination programmes on the continent.',\n",
       " 'A randomised placebo-controlled trial of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was conducted in about 84 500 adults aged 65 years and older, with no particular risk factors. Four years on average after vaccination, there was no reduction in either mortality or the overall incidence of community-acquired pneumonia. It was necessary to vaccinate about 1000 individuals in order to prevent one case of vaccine-type pneumococcal pneumonia during the 4-year follow-up period.',\n",

       " \"We propose an analytical model, which can simultaneously depict many fundamental characteristics of the immunogenicity of various vaccines. This model, the Immune Response (IR) profile, conveniently expresses the mathematical relation between pre- and post-vaccination titers. A vaccine's IR profile is antigen-specific, dose-dependent and post-vaccination interval-dependent. The maximal capability for serological response to a vaccine can be determined using this model irrespective of the dose administered, the post-vaccination assay interval, or the live or killed state of the vaccine. The IR profile obtained from analysis of booster vaccine responses in a limited number of seropositive study subjects can be used to predict maximal antibody titers which are expected after vaccination and can predict the geometric mean post-vaccination antibody titer of a cohort of subjects undergoing primary immunization. Using this model, it is anticipated that the immunoregulation implied by the IR profile may also prove to be correlated with cellular subpopulations and idiotypic antibody functions. Although derived from influenza vaccines analyses, the model successfully describes immune response characteristics following natural infection with malaria and following diphtheria and rubella vaccine administration.\",\n",

       " 'Immunization has been described as a \"global health and development success story,\" and worldwide is estimated to prevent 2-3 million deaths annually.* In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) currently recommends vaccination against 14 potentially serious illnesses by the time a child reaches age 24 months (1). CDC monitors coverage with ACIP-recommended vaccines through the National Immunization Survey-Child (NIS-Child); data from the survey were used to estimate vaccination coverage at the national, regional, state, territorial, and selected local area levels(†) among children born in 2016 and 2017. National coverage by age 24 months was ≥90% for ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine, ≥3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), and ≥1 dose of varicella vaccine (VAR); national coverage was ≥90% for ≥1 dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), although MMR coverage was <90% in 14 states. Coverage with ≥2 doses of influenza vaccine was higher for children born during 2016-2017 (58.1%) than for those born during 2014-2015 (53.8%) but was the lowest among all vaccines studied. Only 1.2% of children had received no vaccinations by age 24 months. Vaccination coverage among children enrolled in Medicaid or with no health insurance was lower than that among children who were privately insured. The prevalence of being completely unvaccinated was highest among uninsured children (4.1%), lower among those enrolled in Medicaid (1.3%), and lowest among those with private insurance (0.8%). The largest disparities on the basis of health insurance status occurred for ≥2 doses of influenza vaccine and for completion of the rotavirus vaccination series. Considering the disruptions to health care provider operations caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, extra effort will be required to achieve and maintain high levels of coverage with routine childhood vaccinations. Providers, health care entities, and public health authorities can communicate with families about how children can be vaccinated safely during the pandemic, remind parents of vaccinations that are due for their children, and provide all recommended vaccinations to children during clinic visits. This will be especially important for 2020-21 seasonal influenza vaccination to mitigate the effect of two potentially serious respiratory viruses circulating in the community simultaneously.',\n",
       " 'In this review, the status of vaccination strategies to reduce bovine tuberculosis of cattle and wildlife reservoirs of the disease is discussed, with a focus on recent developments. Recent work in vaccines to protect humans against tuberculosis has been followed by a similar surge of interest in developing vaccines against bovine tuberculosis. The human vaccine, bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) affords protection against tuberculosis in cattle, but this protection is variable. In addition, vaccination with BCG compromises control strategies based on skin testing animals. In general, no single vaccine approach has shown itself to be significantly superior to BCG alone, however, vaccine combinations of BCG and vaccinating moiety such as adjuvanted subunit, virus vectored or DNA vaccines have been shown to induce protection superior to that achieved by BCG alone. Vaccinating wildlife species against tuberculosis is also an area which has been subjected to scrutiny. Recent work has focused on vaccinating wildlife orally, via the use of BCG formulated in baits consumed by these species. Results from trials in a number of animal species indicate that oral BCG vaccination can reduce disease severity following experimental challenge with Mycobacterium bovis and in a recent field trial, oral BCG vaccination was shown to prevent infection of wild possums following natural exposure to M. bovis. In conclusion, recent studies in cattle and wildlife have demonstrated the practicality and effectiveness of vaccinating animals against tuberculosis and provide much impetus for future use of vaccines.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Combination vaccines offer protection against multiple diseases with fewer injections. This study evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of an investigational diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and meningococcal serogroup C (MenC) heptavalent combination vaccine (heptavalent vaccine) given as 4 doses at 2, 3, 4 and 12-18 months of age. METHODS: In this randomized, open, phase II study (NCT00970307/NCT01171989) conducted in Poland, 421 infants were enrolled to receive the heptavalent vaccine or licensed comparator vaccines. Immunogenicity against study vaccine antigens was measured prior to and 1 month after primary and booster vaccinations. Safety and reactogenicity of the vaccines were also evaluated. RESULTS: The primary noninferiority objectives of the MenC and Hib immune responses induced by the heptavalent vaccine versus comparator vaccines were reached after primary vaccination, but no statistical conclusion could be drawn after booster dose. One month after primary and booster vaccinations, ≥98.4% of the heptavalent vaccine recipients were seroprotected for MenC and Hib. Exploratory analyses indicated that the heptavalent vaccine induced higher postprimary vaccination antibody geometric mean concentrations against Hib, but lower postprimary and postbooster vaccinations geometric mean titers against MenC compared with the relevant comparator vaccines. The reactogenicity profiles of the vaccines were acceptable, although 1 infant vaccinated with the heptavalent vaccine experienced a serious adverse event (thrombocytopenia) considered possibly related to vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The heptavalent vaccine was immunogenic and had a clinically acceptable safety profile when administered to infants and toddlers.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Suspected vaccine allergy may be a cause of incomplete or delayed vaccination. Patients at risk of adverse reactions or suspected contraindications need specialized consultation about subsequent vaccinations. OBJECTIVE: To analyse consultancy results for patients at risk of allergic reactions to vaccines as evaluated by the Green Channel University Hospital Immunization Consultancy Clinic. METHODS: A review of cases of allergic reactions to vaccines or contraindications due to underlying diseases or sensitization to vaccine components submitted to the Green Channel was carried out. Analysed data included detailed clinical reaction history, skin and in vitro allergy testing with vaccine components, recommendations for vaccination and outcome of subsequent vaccine administrations. RESULTS: A total of 519 cases, 370 referred for previous local or systemic reactions to vaccines, mostly cutaneous, and 149 sent for suspected contraindications were evaluated. Skin testing was performed on 152 patients, specific IgE determination in 37 subjects and patch testing in 173 cases. After consultation, 442 (85%) subjects were advised to continue vaccination, with personalized precautions (premedication, or alternative brand, or administration in graded doses) for 200 of them. Among the 352 (80%) patients vaccinated as per Green Channel instructions, 33 subjects (9.3%) reported mild allergic or non-specific symptoms and one (0.3%) urticaria with bronchospasm. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Even though vaccine allergy occurs very rarely, a safe procedure for immunization can be applied, through specialized allergy consultancy, for most subjects with suspected allergy to vaccines, and who could be potentially excluded from vaccination for risk of adverse reactions.',\n",

Controls and vaccinated ducklings were challenged with a virulent Derzsy strain at 21\\u2005days of age (day 20). Weight was measured on days 20, 34 and 42/43. Surviving birds were necropsied on day 42/43. Protection rates were significantly higher in the groups vaccinated once (90 per cent, P=0.003) and twice (95 per cent, P<0.001) than in the control group (59 per cent). The bodyweight was significantly higher in both vaccinated groups than in the control group on day 34 (P=0.008 and P<0.001, respectively) and day 42/43 (P<0.001 for both groups). The growth was significantly higher in the group vaccinated twice than the group vaccinated once on day 34 (P=0.047) and day 42/43 (P=0.017). Both vaccination regimens provided a quick onset of immunity. The higher weight gain in the group vaccinated twice suggests that an early vaccination at hatchery followed by a second injection at 17\\u2005days of age is an optimal and practical schedule to prevent parvovirosis.\",\n",
       " 'Between 1959 and 1996, research was performed to change a vaccine against babesiosis in Australia and to improve it as actual or threatened untoward field responses became apparent. The most significant change occurred in 1964 with the traditionally used carriers of Babesia being replaced as vaccine donors by acutely infected splenectomised calves. This ensured the infectivity of the vaccine and was fortuitously associated with a reduction in the virulence of Babesia bovis in vaccine. Since then, more than 27 million doses of highly infective vaccine have been supplied from the laboratory at Wacol near Brisbane. This vaccine reduced serious losses from babesiosis in vaccinated cattle in Australia to very low levels and has now gained acceptance worldwide. Research to ensure the continuing effectiveness of the vaccine has proved to be essential.',\n",
       " 'Vaccination is considered a key measure to protect vulnerable groups against influenza infection. The objectives of this review are to determine the effect of influenza vaccinations in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza infections, influenza-like illnesses (ILIs), working days lost among vaccinated HCWs, and associated adverse effects after vaccination. Twenty-two healthcare-related databases and internet resources, as well as reference lists, and the bibliographies of all of the retrieved articles were examined. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of any kind of influenza vaccine among all groups of HCWs with a placebo/vaccine other than the influenza vaccine/no intervention were included in the review. Only three RCTs matched the inclusion criteria. There is a limited amount of evidence suggesting that receiving influenza vaccination reduces laboratory-confirmed influenza infections in HCWs. No evidence can be found of influenza vaccinations significantly reducing the incidence of influenza, number of ILI episodes, days with ILI symptoms, or amount of sick leave taken among vaccinated HCWs. There is insufficient data to assess the adverse effects after vaccination. There is no definitive conclusion on the effectiveness of influenza vaccinations in HCWs because of the limited number of related trials. Further research is necessary to evaluate whether annual vaccination is a key measure to protect HCWs against influenza infection and thus increase their confidence in the vaccine. In the mean time, the direction of promoting influenza vaccination to HCWs can be shifted from staff protection to patient protection, with accurate information to address concerns and misconceptions.',\n",
       " 'The optimal design of a veterinary vaccination programme depends on both the characteristics of the vaccine and the epidemiology of the pathogen or parasite. Relevant vaccine characteristics are the proportion of those vaccinated that are initially protected, the duration of protection and the coverage achieved by the vaccination programme. The most important epidemiological parameter is the basic reproduction number, R0. Mathematical theory can integrate this information to address such questions as: whether it is possible to eliminate an infection; what proportion of hosts must be vaccinated to achieve this: what age should hosts first be vaccinated; and at what interval should hosts be revaccinated? Examples of rabies in foxes and foot-and-mouth disease in cattle suggest that theory can be used to guide the design of vaccination programmes.',\n",
       " \"OBJECTIVES: We conducted the first nationwide survey in Slovenia to measure and characterise vaccine confidence among mothers of young children. This survey measured confidence in routine vaccines for children <2\\u202fyears of age and in the information sources about these vaccinations to provide baseline data for public health actions to maintain and improve vaccination coverage. METHODS: We randomly selected women giving birth in 2014-15 from the national perinatal information system (N\\u202f=\\u202f39,497). Participants were asked to rate statements measuring vaccine confidence, including confidence in their child's paediatrician, the Slovenian healthcare system, and different paediatric vaccination information sources. We estimated vaccine confidence with 95% confidence intervals (CI), for seven socio-demographic characteristics for mothers with young children. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to assess correlations between vaccine confidence and the confidence in the health system or child's paediatrician. RESULTS: We sent out 3854 questionnaires, the response rate was 44.4%. While 46.8% (95% CI: 44.4-49.2%) mothers were confident in vaccines, 34.2% (95% CI: 32.0-36.6%) were undecided. We found a correlation (Spearman's rho\\u202f=\\u202f0.457) between vaccine confidence and confidence in the child's paediatrician. Mothers that were confident in paediatrician were more likely to be confident in vaccines (odds ratio: 7.7; 95% CI: 5.3-11.3). Overall, the most frequently trusted information source were physicians (84.6%). In contrast, among mothers not at all confident in vaccines, 51.9% reported friends as the trusted information source. CONCLUSION: More than half of mothers had low vaccine confidence or were undecided regarding their confidence. While vaccination coverage in Slovenia is high, these levels warrant public health intervention, particularly with the undecided mothers. Communication strategies should focus first on undecided parents and involve physicians, who for many are the most trusted vaccine information source. Different approaches will likely be required for those who are not at all confident in vaccines.\",\n",
       " \"INTRODUCTION: Delays in vaccination can stymie the development of herd immunity, and a large proportion of children in the U.S. are known not to receive vaccines on time. This study quantifies delays in vaccination, compares vaccination timeliness to the proportion of children vaccinated, and evaluates the impact of combination vaccine use and timely administration of hepatitis B vaccine birth dose on vaccine timeliness among Michigan children. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Michigan Care Improvement Registry-the state immunization information system-for children born 2006-2010. Children aged 24 months as of December 31, 2012, were included. The proportion of children with timely administration of vaccine doses was calculated, and the mean days of vaccination delay with SD were reported. RESULTS: Among 620,592 Michigan children, 42.2% had received all vaccines, but only 13.2% were vaccinated on time by age 24 months. Children's vaccinations were delayed an average of 59.2 (SD=91.2) days by age 24 months for all recommended vaccine doses. Children who received a timely hepatitis B vaccine birth dose or who received a combination vaccine had less delay in vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Michigan children have high vaccination coverage based on standard measures but few receive these vaccines on time. Promoting use of combination vaccines may improve parental compliance with timely vaccination of children.\",\n",
       " 'Vaccine scepticism is an increasingly important barrier to optimal coverage in developed countries. In this commentary, we make the case that negative attitudes towards vaccines reflect a broader and deeper set of beliefs about health and wellbeing. We suggest that this alternative worldview is influenced by ontological confusions (e.g. regarding purity, natural energy), and knowledge based on personal lived experience and trusted peers, rather than the positivist epistemological framework. Our view is supported by recent social-psychological research, including strong correlations of vaccine scepticism with adherence to complementary and alternative medicine, magical health beliefs, and conspiracy ideation. For certain well-educated and well-resourced individuals, opposition to vaccines represents an expression of personal intuition and agency, in achieving a positive and life-affirming approach to health and wellbeing. These core beliefs are not amenable to change - and especially resistant to communications from orthodox, authoritative sources. Although this view does suggest tactical improvements to messaging, we suggest that a better long-term strategy is to combine with other disciplines in order to address the root causes of vaccine scepticism. Vaccine scepticism is unlikely to thrive in a cultural context that trusts and values the scientific consensus.',\n",

       " 'During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, many individuals did not seek vaccination immediately but rather decided to \"wait and see\" until further information was available on vaccination costs. This behaviour implies two sources of strategic interaction: as more individuals become vaccinated, both the perceived vaccination cost and the probability that susceptible individuals become infected decline. Here we analyze the outcome of these two strategic interactions by combining game theory with a disease transmission model during an outbreak of a novel influenza strain. The model exhibits a \"wait and see\" Nash equilibrium strategy, with vaccine delayers relying on herd immunity and vaccine safety information generated by early vaccinators. This strategic behaviour causes the timing of the epidemic peak to be strongly conserved across a broad range of plausible transmission rates, in contrast to models without such adaptive behaviour. The model exhibits not only feedback mechanisms but also a feed-forward mechanism: a high initial perceived vaccination cost perpetuates high perceived vaccine costs (and lower vaccine coverage) throughout the remainder of the outbreak. This suggests that any effect of risk communication at the start of a pandemic outbreak will be amplified compared to the same amount of risk communication effort distributed throughout the outbreak.',\n",

To boost rates of influenza vaccination in this population, new and untraditional strategies aimed at encouraging first-time vaccination are needed.\",\n",

       " 'A general model of an imperfect vaccine for a childhood disease is presented and the effects of different types of vaccine failure on transmission were investigated using models that consider both homogeneous and age-specific mixing. The models are extensions of the standard SEIR equations with an additional vaccinated component that allows for five different vaccine parameters: three types of vaccine failure in decreasing susceptibility to infection via failure in degree (\"leakiness\"), take (\"all-or-nothingness\") and duration (waning of vaccine-derived immunity); one parameter reflecting the relative reduction in infectiousness of vaccinated individuals who get infected; and one parameter that reflects the relative reduction in reporting probability of vaccinated individuals due to a possible reduction in severity of symptoms. Only the first four parameters affect disease transmission (as measured by the basic reproduction number). The reduction in transmission due to vaccination is different for age-structured models than for homogeneous models. Notably, if the vaccine exhibits waning protection this could be larger for an age-structured model with high contact rates between young children who are still protected by the vaccine and lower contact rates between adults for whom protection might have already waned. Analytic expressions for age-specific \"vaccine impacts\" were also derived. The overall vaccine impact is bounded between the age-specific impact for the oldest age class and that of the youngest age class.',\n",

The challenges involve conceptualizing and measuring the value of vaccines, while the opportunities relate to the strategic and systematic use of that information in health policy decisions that range from the adoption of particular vaccines in national immunization plans to the allocation of resources to vaccine research, development, and delivery. Clarifying the demonstrable individual, family, and community-level benefits of vaccines will allow the public health community to make better-informed and more meaningful comparisons of the costs of vaccines in relation to their full benefits. Taking advantage of this opportunity will require enhanced data collection and the development of strategic planning tools for transparently assessing trade-offs among the myriad attributes of different vaccines in various social and economic contexts.',\n",

The survey was distributed by email to 1069 pediatricians and 1700 GPs and completed by 151 pediatricians (14.1%) and 201 GPs (11.8%). Knowledge of the vaccination calendar was very good (99% overall). Of the respondents, 98% were confident in vaccine efficacy. Eight-one percent of pediatricians and 62% of GPs agreed that recommended vaccinations should become obligatory; all prescribed hexavalent vaccines often or always. More pediatricians (88%) than GPs (75%) used anti-pyretics; the use of anesthetic cream/patches was similar in each group (79% and 75%, respectively). The ambience at vaccination was considered to be important by both groups, and was disturbed in 37% of cases. Seventy percent of pediatricians and 57% of GPs agreed that vaccine reconstitution (e.g., Hib pellet) is a complicating factor: overall, 28% reported occasionally omitting to reconstitute a pentavalent or hexavalent vaccine in error, and 60% reported having not fully reconstituted the vaccine. Almost all (93%) considered non-reconstitution as an important error.Conclusion: Overall, adherence to good vaccination practices was good, although errors in reconstitution were reported by physicians. These problems would be minimized by wider use of fully liquid vaccines. What is Known: • Pediatric vaccination schedules are crowded. • Good vaccination practices and the use of multivalent vaccines are essential to maintain good compliance to pediatric vaccination recommendations.

       " \"BACKGROUND: Myanmar's national immunization program was launched in 1978. Routine immunization is mainly provided at sub-center level with midwives assigned as main vaccinators. The vaccinators at the sub-centers have to obtain vaccines from their designated township health department's cold room for immunization services. This study aimed to calculate the operational costs of routine immunization at sub-centers in Myanmar. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 160 sub-centers throughout the country. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with the main vaccinator at each sub-center using a pre-tested questionnaire. The study analyzed the operational costs per facility and the associations between sub-center characteristics and operational costs. RESULTS: In Myanmar, the average operational costs of routine immunization per sub-center ranged from 434,700-990,125 MMK for rural areas and 235,875-674,250 MMK for urban areas. The operational costs increased by 8,749.50 MMK (95% CI: 6,805.79-10,693.21; p\\u202f<\\u202f0.001) per mile and 5,752.50 MMK (95% CI: 914.22-10,590.79; p\\u202f<\\u202f0.05) per working day. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that the operational costs at sub-centers were high and varied significantly among the different geographical areas. The operational costs could be reduced by additional support for the resources, for example, installing cold chain facilities at sub-centers and opening new sub-centers throughout the country.\",\n",

       " 'OBJECTIVE: A literature review was made to answer the following question: are there differences in immunogenicity and safety of vaccines according to the administration route (intramuscular or subcutaneous) and the length of needles used for injection? DESIGN: The search strategy included electronic searching (Medline database via PubMed) and cross-references. Articles were selected by reading abstracts, guided by the clinical question. A total of 18 articles were selected and analyzed; 13 answered the question. RESULTS: Nine articles compared the immunogenicity and/or the safety of a given vaccine administered via both intramuscular and subcutaneous routes. All the results showed that immunogenicity and systemic safety of the intramuscular route was at least as good as that of the subcutaneous route. Local tolerance was usually better via intramuscular route (lower risk of developing erythema or edema). Four articles compared the immunogenicity and the safety of vaccines administered with short (16mm) and long (25mm) needles in children. Long needles induced fewer local reactions, probably because they can reach more vascularized muscle, especially in overweight and obese patients. CONCLUSIONS: Immunogenicity and safety results are in favor of intramuscular vaccination. The appropriate needle length must to be adapted according to the morphological aspects (subcutaneous tissue and muscle thickness).',\n",
       " 'Easy-to-develop vaccines usually induce antibodies against acute, self-limiting infections by stable pathogens. Today, most of these vaccines have been made, and the future diseases to tackle are more challenging: highly variable pathogens, rapidly emerging new infections with the potential of developing into pandemics, or therapeutic applications for chronic infections and cancer which most likely require complex immune responses beyond the induction of antibodies. The impact of scientific and technological progress on vaccinology has multiplied the strategies to improve vaccines. Here, we describe how genome-based approaches have revolutionized the way to identify vaccine antigen candidates, how the vast numbers of candidates can be further ranked by sophisticated gene- and protein-array based screening methods, and how surface proteomics may accelerate this target identification process. Increased structural knowledge of antigens will allow exposing or stabilizing those antigen parts relevant for protection and thereby direct the immune response to them. Improved adjuvants will enhance and bias the immune response to induce the relevant arms of the immune system. In conclusion, thanks to conceptual and biotechnological progress, future vaccines will be safer, more efficient and more complex than those today.',\n",
       " \"The development of COVID-19 vaccines is occurring at unprecedented speeds, but require high coverage rates to be successful. This research examines individuals' psychological beliefs that may act as enablers and barriers to vaccination intentions. Using the health beliefs model as a guide to our conceptual framework, we explore factors influencing vaccine hesitancy and health beliefs regarding risks and severity of the disease, along with individual variables such as income, age, religion, altruism, and collectivism. A questionnaire using newly created measures for various antecedents provided 4303 usable responses from Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, and the United States. A factor analytic and structural equation model indicates that trust in vaccine approval, the perceived effectiveness of the vaccine for protecting others, and conspiracy beliefs are the most significant drivers of intentions to vaccinate. Older people, those seeking employment, and those who have received a recent influenza vaccine are more likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The findings have implications for improving communication strategies targeting individuals about the merits of vaccination, particularly focusing on younger individuals and expanded message framing to include altruistic considerations, and to improve government transparency regarding the effectiveness and side effects of vaccines.\",\n",

       " 'OBJECTIVES: There is a debate regarding the effect of cost sharing on immunization, particularly as the Affordable Care Act will eliminate cost sharing for recommended vaccines. This study estimates changes in immunization rates and spending associated with extending first-dollar coverage to privately insured children for four childhood vaccines. METHODS: We used the 2008 National Immunization Survey and peer-reviewed literature to generate estimates of immunization status for each vaccine by age group and insurance type. We used the Truven Health Analytics 2006 MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database of line-item medical claims to estimate changes in immunization rates that would result from eliminating cost sharing, and we used the Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research and Educational Trust Employer Health Benefits Survey to determine the prevalence of coverage for patients with first-dollar coverage, patients who face office visit cost sharing, and patients who face cost sharing for all vaccine cost components. We assumed that once cost sharing is removed, coverage rates in plans that impose cost sharing will rise to the level of plans that do not. RESULTS: We estimate that immunization rates would increase modestly and result in additional direct spending of $26.0 million to insurers/employers. Further, these payers would have an additional $11.0 million in spending associated with eliminating cost sharing for children already receiving immunizations. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of eliminating cost sharing for vaccines vary by vaccine. Overall, immunization rates will rise modestly given high insurance coverage for vaccinations, and these increases would be more substantial for those currently facing cost sharing. However, in addition to the removal of cost sharing for immunizations, these findings suggest other strategies to consider to further increase immunization rates.',\n",
       " 'Coccidiosis is a major health problem in rabbits. A vaccine using Eimeria with perfect safety and effectiveness seems to be necessary to face this parasitosis. To assess the safety and the efficacy of a vaccine based on the Algerian precocious line of Eimeria magna against rabbit coccidiosis, twenty eight young rabbits from six litters of Coccidia free females were used to monitor oocystal excretion and body weights, they were distributed into four groups (vaccinated-challenged group, double challenged non vaccinated group, simple challenged non vaccinated group and control group). Three other Coccidia free rabbits served for the necropsy in order to compare the effect of the wild and the precocious strains of Eimeria magna at the histological level. Following the challenge inoculation, a statistically significant decrease of about 97% in the oocyst excretion was noticed in the vaccinated rabbits as a sign of a good immune response acquired by the vaccination associated to a good growth rate. Moreover, a statistically significant increase in oocyst output following the challenge in both double challenged non vaccinated group and simple challenged non vaccinated one was noticed: (1.2\\u2009×\\u200910(8) and 1.5\\u2009×\\u200910(8)vs 4.6\\u2009×\\u200910(6) oocysts/rabbit respectively). Taking the control group showing a steady growth as a reference, the vaccinated rabbits showed a good growth during the experiment (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Globally the challenged groups showed a normal growth compared with the control group except for a temporary decrease in weights. No case of diarrhea was recorded in the vaccinated - challenged group and the control one (neither vaccinated nor challenged) whereas more than 50% of the young rabbits from both simple and double challenged - non vaccinated groups presented diarrhea. Consequently, the Algerian precocious strain of Eimeria magna constitute a good candidate for anticoccidian vaccine in the future.',\n",

The objective of this study was to investigate parental awareness about anti-HPV vaccination in Lower Normandy and to measure their vaccinal intentions before an informative campaign. METHODS: The study population included parents of children aged 10-11\\xa0years enrolled in school (2015-2016) in Lower Normandy, France. The initial study was observational and descriptive. With the agreement of the academic directors, 16\\xa0middle schools were selected. A questionnaire was delivered to the school children and collected in September 2015\\xa0by the school nurses. RESULTS: Within the selected middle schools, 1427\\xa0questionnaires were delivered. School nurses collected 1168\\xa0questionnaires (81.9%) among which 1155\\xa0could be analyzed because they contained answers (80.9%). Out of 575\\xa0girls aged 10-11\\xa0years, 523 (91.0%) were not vaccinated against HPV. Among parents of non-vaccinated schoolgirls who answered, 48.4% did not know if they intended to have their children vaccinated (251\\xa0of 519\\xa0questionnaires). There was a significant association between the socio-professional status of the parents who answered and their intention to vaccinate their daughters against HPV (P=0.03). Parents were significantly more likely to immunize their children when they previously knew about the vaccine (P<0.001) and when they had good knowledge about the vaccine (P<0.05). Parents who previously had their daughters vaccinated were also significantly more likely to have their sons vaccinated against HPV (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The significant association between knowledge about the vaccine and intentions to have their children vaccinated allows us to predict the effectiveness of information campaigns on vaccination rates.',\n",

Determinants of household-level uptake of vaccines need to be examined in high-risk families with CLH. We previously conducted a study on the impact of Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) in 125 HIV-affected families and 47 HIV-unaffected families in West Bengal. We then interviewed 99 of these 172 families who had participated in the study to understand the household-level factors that determine vaccine uptake. Sixty-four of the 99 families had one or more CLH. Within these 64 families, 30% of CLH had missed vaccines under the universal immunization program (UIP), compared to only 6% of HIV-uninfected children (HUC) (p =\\xa0.001). Maternal HIV positivity in a family increased risk of missing UIP vaccines nearly five times (4.82, p =\\xa0.001). Almost all families accessed UIP vaccines at local primary vaccination centers, but 14% of families experienced stigma due to HIV and avoided getting one or more vaccine doses. In contrast, in our study, 100% of HIV-affected families actively sought PCV-13 and HibCV, despite having to travel. Factors that influenced uptake included awareness generation and activation by an outreach worker and availability of vaccines on pick-up days for anti-retroviral therapy. Eighty-six percent of families strongly recommended PCV-13 to other families. To conclude, while we found that CLH have barriers to getting vaccinations, a program designed to take into consideration the obstacles that HIV-affected families face showed a high rate of vaccine uptake.',\n",

       " \"The growing-complexity of the United States Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule has resulted in as many as five required injections during a single well-baby office visit. To reduce this number, vaccine manufacturers have developed combination vaccines that immunize against several diseases in a single injection. At the same time, a growing number of parents are challenging the safety and effectiveness of vaccinating children. They are also particularly concerned about the use of combination vaccines, since they believe that injecting a child with multiple antigens simultaneously may overwhelm a child's immune system. Moreover, combination vaccines make it more likely that extraimmunization (i.e., administering more than the required amount of vaccine antigens) occurs, resulting in greater concerns by parents and vaccine wastage costs borne by an already strained healthcare system. This paper formulates an integer programming model that solves for the maximum number of vaccines that can be administered without any extraimmunization. An exact dynamic programming algorithm and a randomized heuristic for the integer programming model is formulated and the heuristic is shown to be a randomized xi-approximation algorithm. Computational results are reported on three sets of test problems, based on existing and future childhood immunization schedules, to demonstrate their computational effectiveness and limitations. Given that future childhood immunization schedules may need to be solved for each child, on a case-by-case basis, the results reported here may provide a practical and valuable tool for the public health community.\",\n",

       " 'The response people have to vaccination varies because their immune systems differ and vaccine failures occur. Here we consider the effect that a random response, independent for each vaccinee, has on the vaccination coverage required to prevent epidemics in a large community. For a community of uniformly mixing individuals an explicit expression is found for the critical vaccination coverage (CVC) and the effect of the vaccine response is determined entirely by the mean E(AB), where A and B, respectively, reflect the infectivity and susceptibility of a vaccinated individual. This result shows that the usual concept of vaccine efficacy, which focuses on the amount of protection the vaccine provides the vaccinee against infection, is not adequate to describe the requirements for preventing epidemics when vaccination affect infectivity. The estimation of E(AB) poses a problem because A and B refer to the vaccine response of the same individual. Similar results are found when there are different types of individual, but now the mean E(AB) may differ between types. However, for a community made up of households it is shown that the CVC also depends on other characteristics of the vaccine response distribution. In practice this means that estimating a single measure of vaccine effectiveness is generally not enough to determine the CVC. For a specific community of households it is found that the vaccination coverage required to prevent epidemics decreases as the variation in the vaccine response increases.',\n",

Thimerosal is currently used only in multidose vials of influenza vaccine, and exposure through vaccines is not associated with adverse neurologic outcomes. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine is not associated with autism. Vaccines are associated with local reactions, such as pain and erythema. The rotavirus vaccine minimally increases the rate of intussusception, whereas other vaccines minimally increase the risk of syncope. Although immunization with the human papillomavirus vaccine is recommended for all boys and girls, vaccination rates remain low.

YouTube is the most popular video-based social media website. Considering the demonstrated impact of internet on vaccination decision-making and the increasing use of social media to share and disseminate health information, the aim of this study was to explore the message available on YouTube videos about vaccination. METHODS: An observational study was conducted searching for YouTube videos in September 2015 and updated in January 2016, by using the keyword \"vaccinations.\" We included recently posted videos in Italian on child vaccination (2014-2015). Videos were classified according to the message tone. RESULTS: A total of 123 videos were selected. Pro-vaccination videos were 62 (50%), anti-vaccination 28 (23%), neutral or without a clear position in favor or against vaccination 33 (27%).

       " 'OBJECTIVE: To quantify vaccinations administered outside minimum and maximum recommended ages and to determine attendant costs of revaccination by analyzing immunization information system (IIS) records. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed deidentified records of doses administered during 2014 to persons aged <18 years within 6 IIS sentinel sites (10% of the US population). We quantified doses administered outside of recommended ages according to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices childhood immunization schedule and prescribing information in package inserts, and calculated revaccination costs. To minimize misreporting bias, we analyzed publicly funded doses for which reported lot numbers and vaccine types were consistent. RESULTS: Among 3\\u2009394\\u2009047 doses with maximum age recommendations, 9755 (0.3%) were given after the maximum age. One type of maximum age violation required revaccination: 1344 (0.7%) of 194\\u2009934 doses of the 0.25-mL prefilled syringe formulation of quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluzone Quadrivalent, Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, PA) were administered at age ≥36 months (revaccination cost, $111\\u2009964). We identified a total of 7\\u2009529\\u2009165 childhood, adolescent, and lifespan doses with minimum age recommendations, 9542 of which (0.1%) were administered before the minimum age. The most common among these violations were quadrivalent injectable influenza vaccines (3835, or 0.7% of 526\\u2009110 doses administered before age 36 months) and Kinrix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium; DTaP-IPV) (2509, or 1.2% of 208\\u2009218 doses administered before age 48 months).

       " \"INTRODUCTION: Norovirus, a contagious disease that spreads rapidly in close-quartered communities, has a debilitating effect in military settings, affecting troops' health, productivity, and mission-readiness. This research presents a model of norovirus transmission, testing the vaccination's effectiveness in military training centers. METHODS: Transmission was modeled using structured ordinary differential equations, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, genetic resistance, vaccination, and herd-immunity effects, within a hypothetical cohort of trainees and support staff. The modeled vaccine had an efficacy of 72%, 4 weeks after a single dose in phase 2 clinical trials. The transmission model was calibrated against data from a norovirus outbreak in a university setting. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were performed on 22 parameters. RESULTS: The greatest reduction in norovirus cases resulted from prophylactic environmental decontamination and vaccination of trainee and staff populations. These combined interventions prevented more than 6,800 cases of norovirus over the 10-year simulated period-a 15% reduction over the baseline scenario of no interventions. Implementing vaccination and environmental decontamination with an outbreak response threshold of 0.1%, prevented more than 5,300 infections; raising the threshold to 0.2% to 0.5% significantly reduced effectiveness. Environmental decontamination and contact reduction alone had little impact on overall norovirus cases. CONCLUSIONS: Given vaccine characteristics, the model predicted that up to 15% of norovirus cases occurring in training settings over a 10-year period could be prevented by vaccinating all trainees and staff members immediately upon arrival on-base combined with continuous environmental decontamination. There was an impact on morbidity from implementing vaccination of trainees, alone and in combination with staff members. However, vaccinating staff alone prevented few cases over the simulation period, indicating the importance of trainees in norovirus transmission. Likewise, the negligible impact of environmental decontamination or contact reduction alone highlights the importance of addressing both person-to-person and environmental transmission together to minimize illnesses and training downtime.\",\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Concerns regarding vaccine safety are increasing along with lack of compliance to vaccination schedules. This study aimed to assess vaccination-related risks and the impact of a Special Immunization Service (SIS) at the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) of Padua on vaccination compliance among participants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all children attending the SIS from January 1st 2002 to December 31st 2015. The Service is divided into a clinic (SIS-C) where all referred children undergo a pre-vaccination visit and an area within the Pediatric Emergency Department (SIS-PED) where children are vaccinated if indicated. During each SIS-C visit, age, gender, admission criteria and scheduled vaccinations were recorded, with any vaccine-related adverse events captured during SIS-PED visits. Follow-up was conducted to evaluate vaccination plan completion. RESULTS: 359 children received 560 vaccine administrations (41.3% MMR/MMRV, 17.5% hexavalent) at the SIS during the 14 year study. Admission criteria were adverse events after previous vaccination (immediate, IgE/not IgE mediated, and late) in 27.2% of cases, non-anaphylactic allergies (mostly egg allergy) in 42.7% and anaphylaxis in 10.3%. After vaccination, 15/560 (2.7%) mild adverse events were observed. 96.3% of children vaccinated at least once at the SIS-PED and available for follow-up completed their vaccination plan, in contrast to 55.5% of children referred to the SIS-C who were not vaccinated in SIS-PED. CONCLUSIONS: For children referred to SIS-C and available for follow-up, vaccination in SIS-PED was associated with more frequent completion of vaccination plans, indicating a benefit of the service to vaccine coverage. The low number and mild severity of adverse events reported after vaccination of high-risk children in SIS-PED attest to the safety of the service.',\n",

Still, some people do not get vaccinated-either because they cannot (e.g., due to health conditions) or they don't want to (e.g., due to vaccine hesitancy). We investigate whether non-vaccinators' level of responsibility for not being vaccinated affects individuals' motivation to vaccinate and, thus, to indirectly protect non-vaccinators. In Study 1 (N\\u2009=\\u2009101), the intention to vaccinate increased (Cohen's d\\u2009=\\u20090.99) when non-vaccinators were described as willing but unable to get vaccinated (low responsibility) compared to when they were able but unwilling to get vaccinated (high responsibility).

Additionally, knowing about non-vaccinators' low responsibility also increased the willingness to vaccinate compared to when there was no information on non-vaccinators' level of responsibility. Amplified levels of social welfare concerns in the case of non-vaccinators' low responsibility mediated the latter effect. This finding informs effective communication strategies for improving the vaccination rates.\",\n",
       " 'After the March 2020 declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, an analysis of provider ordering data from the federally funded Vaccines for Children program found a substantial decrease in routine pediatric vaccine ordering (1), and data from New York City and Michigan indicated sharp declines in routine childhood vaccine administration in these areas (2,3). In November 2020, CDC interim guidance stated that routine vaccination of children and adolescents should remain an essential preventive service during the COVID-19 pandemic (4,5). To further understand the impact of the pandemic on routine childhood and adolescent vaccination, vaccine administration data during March-September 2020 from 10 U.S. jurisdictions with high-performing* immunization information systems were assessed. Fewer administered doses of routine childhood and adolescent vaccines were recorded in all 10 jurisdictions during March-September 2020 compared with those recorded during the same period in 2018 and 2019. The number of vaccine doses administered substantially declined during March-May 2020, when many jurisdictions enacted stay-at-home orders. After many jurisdictions lifted these orders, the number of vaccine doses administered during June-September 2020 approached prepandemic baseline levels, but did not increase to the level that would have been necessary to catch up children who did not receive routine vaccinations on time. This lag in catch-up vaccination might pose a serious public health threat that would result in vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks, especially in schools that have reopened for in-person learning. During the past few decades, the United States has achieved a substantial reduction in the prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases driven in large part to the ongoing administration of routinely recommended pediatric vaccines. These efforts need to continue even during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce the morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases. Health care providers should assess the vaccination status of all pediatric patients, including adolescents, and contact those who are behind schedule to ensure that all children are fully vaccinated.',\n",

       " \"Vaccinations and the controversy around them always go in parallel. We identified four categories blending in various amounts of truth and imagination: history, myths, shams and frauds. Over the years, they have alternated and sometimes transformed into one another. This sharp separation into categories is certainly academic and forced. In fact, the line between these aspects is not clear enough to allow a rigid and well-defined division. Our work starts from the category containing the most truthfulness: history, and goes on to analyze two categories that add fantasy to facts: myths and shams (or better, &quot;old wives' tales&quot;). The history deals with the topics of variolation and the first anti-vaccine activists' disputes. Myths that arose around immunization include immune overload, homeoprophylaxis, and excessive hygiene. In this context, immunization itself risked becoming a myth, being considered not amenable to improvements. In the category of old wives' tales we find rumors about the presence in the vaccines of considerable quantities of supposedly toxic components such as aluminum, squalene, Thimerosal and nanoparticles, as well as the existence of secret techniques of vaccine preparation that involve unethical procedures. The last category, fraud, is the poorest in both truth and fantasy but it is still hard to confront. The most famous fraud is the supposed link between vaccines and autism. In this frame, disinformation is certainly a fertile substrate for the emergence both of elements close to reality and of very imaginative ones. Vaccine hesitancy is believed to be responsible for decreasing vaccine coverage and increasing the risk of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks and epidemics. The role of communication in immunization is essential to its success, especially taking into account the deep transformations the world of information is going through. The great multitude of voices seem to carry the same weight, but it is not so in science. Web searches are influenced by the filter bubble phenomenon, which contributes to the radicalization of people's opinion through cognitive isolation. A new, more effective strategy of communication is required in order to regain the trust of populations in immunization in a context characterized by the presence of groups impervious to scientific evidence.\",\n",

Literature suggests that waning of ZVL efficacy may necessitate additional vaccination. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended vaccination with RZV in immunocompetent adults aged 50+ years old, including those previously vaccinated with ZVL. The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating US adults aged 60+ years old, previously vaccinated with ZVL. The ZOster ecoNomic Analysis (ZONA) model, a deterministic Markov model, was adapted to follow a hypothetical 1 million(M)-person cohort of US adults previously vaccinated with ZVL. Model inputs included demographics, epidemiology, vaccine characteristics, utilities and costs. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were presented over the lifetimes of the cohort from the year of additional vaccination, discounted 3% annually. The model estimated that, vaccination with RZV 5\\xa0years after previous vaccination with ZVL, would reduce disease burden compared with no additional vaccination, resulting in a gain of 1,633 QALYs at a total societal cost of $96M (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: $58,793/QALY saved). Compared with revaccinating with ZVL, vaccination with RZV would result in a gain of 1,187 QALYs and societal cost savings of almost $84M. Sensitivity, scenario, and threshold analyses demonstrated robustness of these findings. Vaccination with RZV is predicted to be cost-effective relative to no additional vaccination, assuming a threshold of $100,000/QALY, and cost-saving relative to ZVL revaccination of US adults aged 60+ years old who have been previously vaccinated with ZVL.',\n",
       " \"Transmission is a potential property of live viral vaccines that remains largely unexploited but may lie within the realm of many engineering designs. While likely unacceptable for vaccines of humans, transmission may be highly desirable for vaccines of wildlife, both to protect natural populations and also to limit zoonotic transmissions into humans. Defying intuition, transmission alone does not guarantee that a vaccine will perform well: the benefit of transmission over no transmission depends on and increases with the basic reproductive number of the vaccine, R(0). The R(0) of an infectious agent in a homogeneous population is typically considered to be a fixed number, but some evidence suggests that dissemination of transmissible vaccines may change through time. One obvious possibility is that transmission will be greater from hosts directly vaccinated than from hosts who acquire the vaccine passively, but other types of change might also accrue. Whenever transmission changes over time, the R(0) estimated from directly vaccinated hosts will not reflect the vaccine's long term impact. As there is no theory on the consequences of changing transmission rates for a vaccine, we derive conditions for a transmissible vaccine with varying transmission rates to protect a population from pathogen invasion. Being the first in the transmission chain, the R(0) from directly vaccinated hosts has a larger effect than those from later steps in the chain. This mathematical property reveals that a transmissible vaccine with low long term transmission may nonetheless realize a big impact if early transmission is high. Furthermore, there may be ways to artificially elevate early transmission, thereby achieving high herd immunity from transmission while ensuring that the vaccine will ultimately die out.\",\n",

Timeliness and completeness have been considered more important assessment indicators of routine vaccination than overall vaccination coverage, but little is known in rural China. This study aimed to assess the timeliness and completeness of serial routine vaccinations among children in rural Southwest China. METHODS: A multi-stage stratified cluster survey was conducted among 1062 children aged 18-48\\xa0months in rural Guangxi. Vaccination status was obtained from child's vaccination certificate. We calculated timely vaccination coverage, complete vaccination coverage, timely-and-complete vaccination coverage and 95% CI for routine vaccination through weighted estimation analysis. Weighted Kaplan-Meier analyses were applied to estimate the median delay periods for each dose of serial routine vaccines, including one-dose BCG, three-dose HepB, three-dose OPV, four-dose DTP, two-dose MCV, two-dose JEV and two-dose MPV-A. Complete coverage, and timely-and-complete coverage for combined 5-vaccine series were calculated. RESULTS: For each dose of routine vaccines, overall vaccination coverages were over 90%, but timely vaccination coverage ranged from the lowest of 44.4% for JEV1 to the highest of 92.5% for MPV-A1. For multi-dose routine vaccines, complete vaccination coverages varied from the lowest of 92.9% for MCV to the highest of 100% for HepB, and timely-and-complete vaccination coverages were lower than 80%, ranging from the lowest of 30% for JEV to the highest of 77.2% for MPV-A. For combined 5-vaccine series, complete coverage was 77%, while timely-and-complete coverage was 12.1%. MPV-A1 had the longest median delay of 176\\xa0days, but BCG and HepB1 had the shortest of 1\\xa0day. CONCLUSIONS: The overall coverages of serial routine vaccinations were high, but the timeliness and completeness were poor. Relevant agencies of vaccination service should address timeliness-and-completeness into the assessment indicators of routine vaccination service quality.\",\n",

       " 'INTRODUCTION: Half of all new human papillomavirus (HPV) infections occur in adolescents and young adults, and this population has poor HPV vaccination rates. Rural areas of the U.S. have high rates of HPV-related diseases and low vaccination rates as well. The purpose of this study was to determine the perceived barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination among adolescents and their caregivers in rural south Alabama. METHODS: Vaccinated and non-vaccinated adolescents ages 11-18\\u202fyears old and primary caregivers were recruited from three rural counties in south Alabama. Participants completed individual interviews to discuss perceived barriers to vaccination and factors influencing their decision to vaccinate. Discussion groups were held to determine potential solutions to barriers elucidated from the interviews. Interview and discussion group transcripts were analyzed, and themes were identified. RESULTS: Approximately 62.5% of adolescents had not initiated the HPV vaccine series. Of those adolescents who started the vaccine series (n\\u202f=\\u202f9, 37.5%), about half completed it (n\\u202f=\\u202f5). Few participants in this study reported speaking with their health care provider (HCP) about the vaccine in the past year. Lack of information about the vaccine, its side effects, and no HCP recommendation were common barriers cited by non-vaccinators. Facilitators to vaccination included cancer prevention, discussion with HCP, and peer testimonials. Potential solutions to barriers were also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Proposed strategies to increase HPV vaccination were similar between vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups. Education about HPV and the HPV vaccine is needed throughout these rural south Alabama communities to ensure informed decisions are made about vaccination and to increase vaccination rates.',\n",

       " \"BACKGROUND: With approximately 3 billion people at risk of acquiring the infection, dengue fever is now considered the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in the world, with 390 million dengue infections occurring every year, of which 96 million manifest symptoms with any level of disease severity. Treatment of uncomplicated dengue cases is only supportive and severe dengue cases require hospital intensive care. A vaccine now licensed in several countries and developed by Sanofi Pasteur (CYD-TDV, named Dengvaxia), was able to protect, in the first 25 months of the two Phase III, 66% of a subset of 9-16 year old participants. However, a significantly lower efficacy (including negative vaccine efficacy) was noted for children younger than 9 years of age. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Analysis of year 3 results of phase III trials of Dengvaxia suggest high rates of protection of vaccinated partial dengue immunes but high rates of hospitalizations during breakthrough dengue infections of persons who were vaccinated when seronegative, with vaccine appearing to induce enhancing antibodies (ADE). An age structured model was developed based on Sanofi's recommendation to vaccinate persons age 945 years in dengue endemic countries. The model was used to explore the clinical burden of two vaccination strategies: 1) Vaccinate 4 or 20% of individuals, ages 9-45 years, seropositives and seronegatives, and 2) vaccinate 4 or 20% of individuals, ages 9-45 years, who are dengue immune only. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that vaccinating dengue monotypic immune individuals prevents dengue hospitalizations, but at the same time dengue infections of vaccine-sensitized persons increases hospitalizations. When the vaccine is given only to partial immune individuals, after immunological screening of the population, disease burden decreases considerably.\",\n",
       " 'Although a proven and effective preventive health measure, childhood immunization programs remain vulnerable to budgetary pressures. Sustainable financing of immunization programs is an important issue that presents a challenge for middle-income countries (MIC) in particular, in part due to technological advances meaning more vaccines are available. This study aimed to analyse trends in immunization program investment across 15 MIC selected based on availability of data, income level classification, and regional representativeness. We assessed investment trends in relation to vaccine coverage, vaccine access, and broader health indicators. Immunization and expenditure data were obtained from the World Health Organisation (WHO) database and the WHO UNICEF Joint Reporting Form and WHO Vaccine Product, Price and Procurement from 2006-2016. We calculated a weighted average index of vaccine commitment (WAIVC) based on vaccine coverage, vaccine scope, and weighted by vaccine innovation measured by approximating vaccine expenditure. Correlation analyses were conducted between immunization expenditure per-capita and each WAIVC, infant mortality and life expectancy. Correlation analyses at a global and individual country level indicate an improvement in immunization access, vaccination commitment measured by WAIVC, and scope of available vaccines in countries with sustained increases in vaccination funding. Increases in national immunization expenditure were correlated with reduced infant mortality and increased life expectancy. Vaccine expenditure comprises a small proportion (less than 2%) of total healthcare spending and has not uniformly increased in accordance with the scope of available vaccines. The present analysis supports the premise that countries with consistent increases in vaccine expenditure have increased vaccine coverage and commitment measured by WAIVC and improved broader health outcomes, indicating the value of sustained investment in vaccination for improved population health. The benefits of vaccine expenditure in this holistic fashion are critical to inform policy decisions on national budget allocation for vaccine funding.',\n",
       " \"The Croatian Immunization Programme is a mandatory prevention programme in which vaccines are offered free of charge and little is known about parental vaccine-related beliefs and attitudes. We aimed to describe beliefs and attitudes towards childhood vaccination of parents in Zagreb, estimate the proportion of parents with positive attitudes towards vaccination, and to identify the possible predictors of positive attitudes. Using a self-administered questionnaire, we performed a cluster sampling survey among parents of 6-years-old children in Zagreb. In total 542 questionnaires were collected, 80% (n\\u202f=\\u202f430/542) of respondents were mothers. Even though 72.6% (n\\u202f=\\u202f385/531; 95%CI: 69-76) respondents feel that childhood vaccination should remain mandatory, 36.3% (n\\u202f=\\u202f192/528; 95%CI: 58.3-65.3) considered that simultaneous administration of vaccines can have negative effect to their child's health. In addition, 38% (n\\u202f=\\u202f202/532; 95%CI: 33.2-43.1%) feared that vaccines may harm their child. Of total, parents mostly reported positive attitude towards vaccination (61.8%; 95% CI: 34.7-42). Parents with positive attitudes were more likely to state their child experienced mild or no adverse reaction after vaccination, report not delaying vaccination and provide additional non-mandatory vaccines to their child (p\\u202f<\\u202f0.05). Gender, age, education and marital status of parent were not significantly associated with the positive attitude towards vaccination. Our results suggest the need for educational interventions and communication strategies that could foster better knowledge on immunization with a focus on parental misconceptions, perceived constraints and safety issues about vaccine.\",\n",
       " 'In a field trial, the development of antibodies of a combined vaccine against the porcine parvovirus (PPV) as well as against swine erysipelas was compared with corresponding mono vaccines. Furthermore, these vaccines were used in different vaccination schedules. The tests were carried out on 109 gilts in three closed farms. In all gilts, a basic immunization repeated twice was carried out at the age of six months and at intervals of three weeks. The revaccination was carried out four months after the basic immunization with half of the animals, and six months after the basic immunization with the remaining gilts. Between the combined vaccine and the mono vaccine no significant differences in the development of antibodies against PPV could be found according to different vaccination schedules. The gilts having been vaccinated with the mono vaccine and boostered six months later showed significantly higher antibody titers against Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. Between the remaining vaccination groups no significant difference in the development of the antibodies against swine erysipelas could be found. On only one farm, a continuous decrease of antibody titers against PPV in case of altogether 238 non-vaccinated piglets until the sixth month of life could be observed. On the two other farms, an increase of antibody titers against PPV could be found at different points of time, which indicates an infection of the piglets. Between the individual vaccination groups no significant antibody titers against PPV could be measured in milk tests. With regard to the number of piglets born alive per litter, the number of piglets born dead per litter and the number of mummies, a significant difference could neither be found between the vaccination groups 1-4.',\n",
       " 'Vaccines have had a very significant impact in Human Health. Except for public water supply and sanitation measure, no other single public health intervention induced such a significant reduction in disease incidence and child mortality. In Portugal, a National Vaccination Program (NVP) began in 1965 and more recently, in January 2006, the new NVP was implemented. However, it is important to recognize and understand adverse reaction to vaccines, since this therapy is intended to be administered to healthy individuals, a fact which considerably lowers the threshold of acceptability of adverse reactions by the general public. In such a way, better understanding of vaccine adverse reactions allows a correct diagnosis and a more appropriate selection of vaccines, increasing the acceptance of immunization in the community.',\n",
       " \"Children who begin but do not fully complete the recommended series of childhood vaccines by 2 y of age are a much larger group than those who receive no vaccines. While parents who refuse all vaccines typically express concern about vaccine safety, it is critical to determine what influences parents of 'partially' immunized children. This case-control study examined whether parental concern about vaccine safety was responsible for partial immunization, and whether other personal or system-level factors played an important role. A random sample of parents of partially and completely immunized 2 y old children were selected from a Canadian regional immunization registry and completed a postal survey assessing various personal and system-level factors. Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) and adjusted ORs (aOR) were calculated with logistic regression. While vaccine safety concern was associated with partial immunization (OR 7.338, 95% CI 4.138-13.012), other variables were more strongly associated and reduced the strength of the relationship between concern and partial immunization in multivariable analysis (aOR 2.829, 95% CI 1.151-6.957). Other important factors included perceived disease susceptibility and severity (aOR 4.629, 95% CI 2.017-10.625), residential mobility (aOR 3.908, 95% CI 2.075-7.358), daycare use (aOR 0.310, 95% CI 0.144-0.671), number of needles administered at each visit (aOR 7.734, 95% CI 2.598-23.025) and access to a regular physician (aOR 0.219, 95% CI 0.057-0.846). While concern about vaccine safety may be addressed through educational strategies, this study suggests that additional program and policy-level strategies may positively impact immunization uptake.\",\n",

       " 'There is a wide range of methods and technologies aimed at improving human vaccine products and the way they are delivered. Some of these have the potential to increase vaccine effectiveness in specific populations and may furthermore help to increase vaccine access, reduce costs, and ease the logistical burdens of immunization programs, especially in low-resource settings. One strategy under evaluation is the use of intradermal (ID) delivery of vaccines, which has been shown to result in dose sparing with some vaccines. Novel ID delivery devices could enable needle-free and therefore safer and more reliable ID administration than current ID injection methods, facilitating ID delivery and dose sparing with existing or new vaccines. There are promising clinical data with some vaccines that highlight the potential of reduced-dose immunization via the ID route. And more studies are under way. However, a number of clinical and technical research as well as operational challenges exist, including establishing the optimal doses for different vaccines, reformulating to adjust antigen concentration or add preservatives, matching vaccine vial volume to session size, working with vaccine manufacturers to achieve regulatory clearance for ID delivery, and developing ID delivery devices suitable for the varying scenarios of use of different vaccines. These will need to be addressed before the benefits of ID delivery and the impact of novel ID delivery technologies on human health are fully realized.',\n",
       " \"Recent data have shown that the immune protection evoked by vaccines given in the first years of life progressively weakens, and that this is associated with a higher than expected incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases in adolescents and young adults. Furthermore, the greater circulation of pathogens among adolescents and young adults leads to a high risk of infection in unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated younger children. These findings, together with the availability of vaccines specifically developed to prevent infections that typically occur during adolescence, have induced a number of experts to suggest radical changes in the immunisation schedules usually recommended by health authorities. The most important of these relate pertussis, meningococcal and human papillomavirus vaccines but, although they are based on unexceptionable scientific premises, the suggestions have been only slowly and partially received in most countries, even in those in which vaccination programmes are usually adequately implemented and monitored. Adolescence is a particular period of life characterised by changes in intellectual, moral, physical, emotional and psychological development. All of these can have a considerable impact on compliance with immunisation schedules because the approach to any preventive method no longer entirely depends on parents' and pediatricians' judgements as in the first years of life but is the consequence of a more complex process involving the adolescents' thoughts and opinions, their relationships with their parents, friends and physicians, and the information they receive from the mass media. Every effort should be made to overcome the barriers to adolescent immunisation, including those arising from the adolescents themselves.\",\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: In 2003, a pentavalent vaccine (diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis, injectable polio and hepatitis B) was introduced into the childhood vaccination schedule. A premarketing study showed a higher incidence of fever than with the vaccines administered separately. Because fevers in young infants prompt medical evaluations, this study examines the impact of this vaccine (DTaP-IPV-HB) on subsequent use of health services. METHODS: We compared use of health services among 6- to 10-week-old infants receiving DTaP-IPV-HB (n = 1776) with a historical control receiving the prior schedule (n = 2162) at an inner-city practice network. Data sources included a hospital immunization registry and medical records. Outcome measures were visits to the emergency department and ambulatory practices, fever, tests, antibiotics and hospitalizations. Outcomes were stratified by age (<8, 8-10 weeks) and days since vaccination (3, 7). RESULTS: Infants vaccinated with DTaP-IPV-HB were more likely to visit the ED (1.2% versus 0.6%, P = 0.03) and receive tests (47.6% versus 8.3%, P = 0.03) within 3 days of vaccination compared with the controls. Multivariate analysis showed infants vaccinated with DTaP-IPV-HB had a 7-fold increased risk of receiving a full sepsis workup and a 3-fold increased risk of receiving antibiotics within 7 days of vaccination. Medical evaluations decreased over time after implementation of the DTaP-IPV-HB vaccine. Concurrently, the rate of vaccination for infants <8 weeks markedly dropped. CONCLUSIONS: The DTaP-IPV-HB vaccine was associated with increased use of health services in the emergency department, but these associations lessened over time. These findings reveal a conflict between the obligation of timely and efficient vaccination with the medical management of febrile young infants.',\n",
       " \"With little or no evidence-based information to back up claims of vaccine danger, anti-vaccine activists have relied on the power of storytelling to infect an entire generation of parents with fear of and doubt about vaccines. These parent accounts of perceived vaccine injury, coupled with Andrew Wakefield's fraudulent research study linking the MMR vaccine to autism, created a substantial amount of vaccine hesitancy in new parents, which manifests in both vaccine refusal and the adoption of delayed vaccine schedules. The tools used by the medical and public health communities to counteract the anti-vaccine movement include statistics, research, and other evidence-based information, often delivered verbally or in the form of the CDC's Vaccine Information Statements. This approach may not be effective enough on its own to convince vaccine-hesitant parents that vaccines are safe, effective, and crucial to their children's health. Utilizing some of the storytelling strategies used by the anti-vaccine movement, in addition to evidence-based vaccine information, could potentially offer providers, public health officials, and pro-vaccine parents an opportunity to mount a much stronger defense against anti-vaccine messaging.\",\n",

The aim of our study is to document trends in the AEFI reporting ratio globally and across the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions. We describe the number of AEFI reports communicated each year through the World Health Organization/United Nations Children's Fund Joint Reporting Form on Immunization from 2000 to 2015. The AEFI reporting ratios (annual AEFI reports per 100,000 surviving infants) were calculated to identify WHO countries (n\\u202f=\\u202f191 in 2000 and n\\u202f=\\u202f194 by 2015) that met a minimal reporting ratio of 10, a target set by the Global Vaccine Action Plan for vaccine safety monitoring as a proxy measure for a functional AEFI reporting system. The number of countries reporting any AEFI fluctuated over time but with progress from 32 (17%) in 2000 to 124 (64%) in 2015. In 2015, the global average AEFI reporting ratio was 549 AEFI reports per 100,000 surviving infants. The number of countries with AEFI reporting ratios\\u202fgreater than\\u202f10 increased from 8 (4%) in 2000 to 81 (42%) in 2015.

Overall, AEFI reporting has increased over the past sixteen years worldwide, but requires strengthening in a majority of low- and middle- income countries. The AEFI reporting ratio is useful for benchmarking and following trends over time; but does not provide information on the quality of the reporting system and does not guarantee capacity to detect and manage a vaccine safety problem at a national level. Additional efforts are required to ensure and improve data quality, AEFI reporting and surveillance of immunization safety in every country.\",\n",
       " 'Health officials often face challenges in communicating the risks associated with not vaccinating, where persuasive messages can fail to elicit desired responses. However, the mechanisms behind these failures have not been fully ascertained. To address this gap, an experiment (N\\xa0=\\xa0163) tested the differences between loss-framed messages-one emphasizing the consequence of not receiving a flu vaccine; the other emphasizing the consequence of receiving the flu vaccine. Despite an identical consequence (i.e., Guillain-Barre syndrome), the message highlighting the consequence of not receiving the flu vaccine produced lower negative affect scores as compared to the message highlighting the consequence of receiving the flu vaccine. Mediation analyses suggest that one reason for this difference is due to non-vaccination being perceived as temporary and reversible, whereas vaccination is perceived as being permanent. Implications on health communication and future research are discussed.',\n",

       " 'Several characteristics of BHV-1 have contributed to the successful development of both conventional and marker vaccines. BHV-1 is a stable virus, which grows to high titers in vitro, has a limited host range and causes acute viremic infections. Furthermore, the protective antigens, as well as the antigens that are suitable as marker, are present in the predominant virus isolates and induce significant and long-lasting immune responses, both in naïve and in previously vaccinated animals. In many parts of the world including North-America control of BHV-1 is achieved by vaccination with conventional attenuated or inactivated vaccines. With parts of Europe being BHV-1 free, the ability to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals has become critical as a trading tool. Live and killed gE-deleted marker vaccines are now widely used in Europe, in combination with gE-based diagnostic tests to monitor cattle. However, several issues remain to be resolved. BHV-1 causes latency, which creates a need for stringent management practices in case eradication is to be achieved. Since intramuscular delivery with a syringe and needle leads to considerable tissue damage, needle-free delivery methods should be adopted for beef cattle. Furthermore, conventional inactivated and attenuated vaccines are less efficacious in neonates, so alternative vaccine types such as CpG adjuvanted protein vaccines or DNA vaccines are required for effective vaccination of this age group.',\n",

       " \"Vaccination of all healthy children against rotavirus (RV) has been recommended, since the availability of vaccines, both in Europe (PIDJ) and Italy (pediatricians). The aims of universal vaccination against RV include the protection of children against moderate/severe gastroenteritis forms by RV (GARV), prevent hospitalizations, reduce the severity and duration of the disease, and reduce morbidity and socioeconomic costs. Payers need to informed regarding the efficacy and the healthcare utilization related to RV vaccination in order to decide in favour of its extensive implementation. The aim of this paper is to assess the clinical and financial impact of the extensive vaccination aganist RV both at National and Regional level. Particular attention, compared to the previous analysis (Standaert et al, 2008) has been given to the influence of herd immunity (HI) on cost-utility results of vaccination against-RV. Methods. The analysis was conducted with the Markovian model previously used by Standaert B et al and updated for comparing costs and benefits associated with a situation of vaccination anti-RV that includes efficacy data due to HI, with a situation without vaccination. For the base case is assumed an annual coverage of 90%, where the effect of HI is present in the population at risk (0-5 years) and extended to children who have not been vaccinated, adding as conservative assumption, a further 10% to the efficacy of the vaccine, compared to 15% determined by several published studies. Two analysis have been made based on this model: a cost-utility analysis that compared vaccination with two doses of RIX441410 administered at 2 and 3 months after birth compared with no vaccination from National Health Service and Society perspective; a budget impact analysis at National and Regional level. The evaluation has as its main element the reduction of cases of infection through universal vaccination and consequent reduction of Garv events and nosocomial infections. Results. From the NHS perspective, in a cohort of 555,791 born in Italy in 2011, the annual number of hospitalizations due to RV infections in the absence of vaccination is estimated to be 14,550 units. Assuming that 90% of newborns receive two doses of the vaccine, and including an additional effect of HI to the efficacy of the vaccine, vaccination would lead to a reduction of 71% of cases of Garv (176,804 cases in less) and a 86% of hospitalizations due to Garv (12,913 fewer cases), with an impact on quality of life and mortality as a consequence of vaccination. The introduction of the vaccine would lead to a gain of 0.0014 QALYs and 0.0022 life-years gained per child compared to a situation without vaccination (assuming a discount rate of 3% on future benefits). The reduction of GARV also would lead to a strong economic impact. The introduction of the vaccine would lead to a saving of € 25.41 per child or a saving of more than € 14 million for the whole population included in the analysis. Cost reduction increase significantly from the perspective of society and introducing the indirect costs due to lost productivity. In this case, the savings due to the introduction of vaccination would increase to € 67,747,654 in the total cohort, or € 121.89 per child. In an alternative scenario, where HI is excluded, RIX4414 remains dominant (0.0013 QALYs gained and € 22.14 per child saved). The budget impact analysis shows that, as early as the second year, the additional cost of the vaccine is more than offset by a reduction in costs of the disease, which leads to savings for the NHS, which increases from year 3. In a time horizon of 5 years (without the discount rate), the savings for the NHS amount to € 34,440,314. These savings would amount to a cost reduction of € 4.64 per child over 5 years (€ 0.93 per year). The savings due to the introduction of the vaccine were mainly due to a reduction in costs associated with hospitalizations. The budget impact analysis at regional level, has taken a vaccine cost of € 30.00 per dose. Cases of diarrhoea before after vaccination are reduced in each region, based on the number of births, ranging from a minimum of 399 cases avoided for Valle d'Aosta to a maximum of 31,116 cases avoided in Lombardy. In a similar way, the number of hospitalizations due to GARV are reduced considerably, from a minimum of 36 cases in Valle d'Aosta to a maximum of 3,096 in Lombardy. Obviously, these reductions are greater in regions with 30,000 or more births per year. Conclusions. This study suggests that a universal vaccination anti-RV with 2 doses of RIX4414 brings significant clinical and economic benefits both at National and Regional level. The indirect effects of the vaccine (HI) could generate protection even in unvaccinated children with health gain and a number of cases by GARV much less than those that would vaccinating small groups of children and with a cost of illness, for NHS, which would be reduced significantly, despite the additional costs of the vaccine as early as the second year of vaccination. Productivity losses due to absence from work of a parent, as well as all other costs included in the model, show that is precisely the society to pay the consequences, from economic and social point of view. Considering the citizen in the role of private payer, we must stress as for him, the savings generated by vaccination, whether universal or with demand for cost-sharing by the health service, prove significant with a major health gain for the population under study.\",\n",

In a randomly chosen study group (N = 163), 91 elderly patients (56 per cent) had received the pneumococcal vaccine. Factors associated with a higher rate of pneumococcal vaccination included receiving the previous year's influenza vaccine, a medical problem list attached to the patient's chart, active clinic status (i.e., seen in the year before the study began), and more than two problems listed in the computer record. Letters encouraging pneumococcal vaccination were then sent to patients who had not been vaccinated.

       " \"CONTEXT: Restaurant employees represent a substantial portion of the US workforce, interact closely with the public, and are at risk for contracting influenza, yet their influenza vaccination rates and attitudes are unknown. OBJECTIVE: Assess influenza vaccination rates and attitudes among Seattle restaurant employees, to identify factors that could enhance the success of a restaurant-based vaccination program. DESIGN: In 2012, we invited employees of Seattle restaurants to complete an anonymous paper survey assessing participant demographics, previous influenza vaccination status, and personal attitudes toward influenza vaccination (using a 5-point scale). SETTING: Sit-down, full service restaurants in or near Seattle, Washington, were eligible if they had no previous history of offering worksite influenza vaccinations and had more than 20 employees who were older than 18 years and spoke either English or Spanish. PARTICIPANTS: We invited staff in all restaurant positions (servers, bussers, kitchen staff, chefs, managers, etc) to complete the survey, which was available in English and Spanish. RESULTS: Of 428 restaurant employees surveyed, 26% reported receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine in 2011-2012 (response rate = 74%). Across 8 attitude statements, participants were most likely to agree that the vaccine is not too expensive (89%), and least likely to agree that it is relevant for their age group (25%), or normative at their workplace (13%). Vaccinated participants reported significantly more positive attitudes than unvaccinated participants, and Hispanics reported significantly more positive attitudes than non-Hispanic whites. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing influenza vaccination rates among restaurant employees could protect a substantial portion of the US workforce, and the public, from influenza.

       " 'OBJECTIVES: To incorporate the assessment of vaccination status and administration of vaccines in an appointment-based model (ABM) and measure the impact on vaccinations administered and patient and pharmacist satisfaction with the appointment-based model. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: An ABM was implemented to systematically assess vaccination status and administer vaccines. Patients made an appointment to pick up synchronized prescriptions, and pharmacists assessed vaccination histories and administered vaccinations during the appointment. In addition, pharmacists could access the statewide immunization information system to objectively determine vaccination histories and document administered vaccines. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: This project was conducted at 24 Kroger Pharmacies in the Cincinnati-Dayton Area. Any patient filling more than 1 maintenance medication was eligible for the ABM program. Pharmacists were encouraged to target patients at high risk for medication problems and vaccine-preventable diseases, including patients 60 years of age or older with more than 5 medications and high-risk disease states such as diabetes, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. EVALUATION: Pharmacies were randomized, and an a priori analysis was conducted to ensure that the 24 intervention and 78 control stores were similar at baseline. Postimplementation data on the mean number of vaccines per store were compared between the intervention stores and the control stores from September 2014 through December 2015. Patient and pharmacist satisfaction with the ABM was assessed via surveys. RESULTS: The pharmacist vaccine assessment as part of the ABM program showed higher overall mean vaccinations per store compared with the control group during the project period (1810.71 ± 500.88 vs. 1455.09 ± 754.43; P\\xa0= 0.01). Patients and pharmacists felt that the ABM program facilitated vaccine discussions. CONCLUSION: The ABM program with a focus on vaccinations allowed pharmacists to systematically assess patient vaccination histories and administer vaccines in the pharmacy. Patients and pharmacists appreciated the dedicated time to discuss vaccinations.',\n",

The work of Balmis as director of the Expedition and Salvany, his Assistant Director, not only included vaccinating children but also the development of an organised model for its application. The model was based on a network of centres created to protect and transport the vaccine fluids in good condition until they reached their vaccination sites and how to conduct a census of vaccinated people. In order to improve vaccine acceptability, local health workers were incorporated and the press was used to disseminate news. The strategy developed served as an antecedent that, two hundred years later, is unquestionably similar to health planning models such as Pineault and Daveluy, used in modern vaccination campaigns.\",\n",

       " 'Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), a rapidly progressing and potentially fatal illness, disproportionately affects adolescents and young adults. While IMD is best prevented by vaccination, vaccine uptake in these groups is low. An evidence-based understanding of the safety and effectiveness of concomitant vaccination of meningococcal vaccines, including the newer MenB protein vaccines and the more established MenACWY conjugate vaccines, with other vaccines recommended for adolescents and young adults may help maximize vaccination opportunities. We identified 21 studies assessing concomitant administration of meningococcal vaccines with other vaccines in adolescents and adults. Although studies varied in methodology, concomitant administration generally did not affect immunogenicity of the meningococcal or coadministered vaccines. In some cases, reactogenicity increased following concomitant administration, but no definitive safety concerns were raised. In general, data suggest that meningococcal vaccines can be safely and effectively coadministered with other vaccines.',\n",

       " 'Porcine circovirus type-2 (PCV2) is widespread in domestic pig populations. It can be shed with boar semen, but the role boars have in epidemiology is still unclear. Vaccinating boars against PCV2 can reduce disease and virus load in semen, but may have unwanted side effects, that is, impairment of spermatogenesis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect and impact of two different PCV2 vaccines on boar semen quality and quantity. Healthy normospermic Large White boars in three groups of 12 each were vaccinated with either Circovac, Ingelvac CircoFLEX, or received NaCl. Eight ejaculates were collected starting 1\\xa0week after vaccination and assessed for quantitative traits. In general, sperm quantity and quality parameters did not change due to the vaccination (P\\xa0>\\xa00.05). Only DNA integrity between the Circovac and control group was P\\xa0<\\xa00.05 but remained at a low level (<2%). One boar showed clinical signs with body temperature up to 39.9\\xa0°C and went off feed. For this animal, a clear relation between vaccination, fever period, and impaired sperm quality could be observed. The results indicate that both vaccines did not have a major impact on sperm quality or quantity. Therefore, vaccination of boars against PCV2 seems to be feasible. However, one boar treated with the oil-based vaccine showed a temporarily impaired semen quality after elevated body temperature after vaccination. Thus, possible systemic reactions and the subsequent impact on sperm quality should be taken into account when choosing a PCV2 vaccine for boars.',\n",
       " 'Vaccinating healthcare workers against influenza takes tens of thousands of hours of work annually. This study was undertaken to determine the acceptability, success rate, and time to vaccinate healthcare workers in nurse-led groups that self-vaccinated with intradermal influenza vaccine compared with nurse-administered intramuscular vaccine. METHODS: Volunteer hospital workers were randomly assigned to groups that either self-administered intradermal influenza vaccine (Intanza(®)) in a nurse-led group or received nurse-administered intramuscular vaccine (Vaxigrip(®)). Research assistants timed vaccination procedures; pre- and post-injection questionnaires assessed acceptability and reactogenicity. RESULTS: 810 adults, 21-69 years of age, from two study sites were vaccinated: 401 self-administered the intradermal vaccine while 409 received their intramuscular vaccine from a nurse. Of those who self-administered for the first time, 98.5% were successful on their first attempt with an additional 1.5% on their second attempt. Acceptability was high: 96% were very or somewhat certain that they administered the vaccine correctly, 83% would choose intradermal influenza vaccine again and of those, 75% would choose self-administration again, if given the choice. It took 51.3-72.6s per person for the nurses to guide the groups through the self-administration process, which was significantly less time than it took to individually administer the intramuscular vaccines (93.6s). CONCLUSION: Self-administration of intradermal influenza vaccine by people working in healthcare settings is a possible alternative to nurse administered vaccinations, with nurse-led group sessions a good way of teaching the technique while being available to respond to unanticipated problems (NCT01665807).',\n",
       " 'The efficacy of vaccination of Argentinean cattle against babesiosis and anaplasmosis using live immunogens was tested to detect specific antibodies in samples obtained about 60 days after vaccination. Under these conditions a higher than expected proportion of cattle failed to show antibodies against Babesia bigemina. Therefore, a study was designed to evaluate if this failure was due to insensitivity of the routine test to detect antibodies to B. bigemina or to lack of infectivity of the live vaccine. Four groups (G) of cattle were each inoculated subcutaneously with 10 million Babesia bovis (vaccinal strain R1A), 10 million B. bigemina (vaccinal strain S1A) and 10 million Anaplasma centrale (strain M1). G1 and G2 consisted of ten Angus bulls 20-24 months old and ten Angus bulls 15-18 months old, respectively; G3 and G4 consisted of ten and 16 Holstein 1-month-old male calves, respectively. Blood samples were obtained on days 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 after vaccination and the sera were analysed with an indirect immunofluorescent (IFA) test to detect antibodies to B. bovis (baseline dilution for a positive result 1:60) and B. bigemina (baseline dilution 1:120). Positive IFA titres were considered as evidence of the infectivity of the Babesia vaccinal strains contained in the vaccine. All Angus bulls were found positive to antibodies against both Babesia species, by day 20 (B. bovis) and day 30 (B. bigemina), whereas 10-25% of Holstein calves were negative throughout. The partial lack of vaccine infectivity in the calves was considered to be a consequence of innate resistance of young calves to Babesia. Antibody titres to B. bovis and B. bigemina declined by day 60 after vaccination. However, all cattle that were positive to B. bovis antibodies on day 50 were still positive to the IFA test 10 days later while 10%, 30% and 12% of cattle of G1, G2 and G3 that were positive to B. bigemina antibodies on day 50 after vaccination were found negative to the IFA test on day 60. In future, samples taken on days 40-50 will be used for detection of B. bigemina antibodies in vaccinated cattle, on day 60 for A. centrale and on either occasion for B. bovis. The reaction to the inoculation of B. bigemina S1A strain appears to lag behind the reaction to B. bovis R1A strain. It is not certain if this is a normal reaction to this B. bigemina strain or the result of interaction with the B. bovis strain.',\n",

       " \"Canine rabies vaccination is delivered in Thungsong District, Thailand, as an annual campaign between March 1 and 31, and also at other times through private veterinary clinics, para-veterinarians and health-care staff residing in the villages. The current questionnaire-interview survey was conducted between June 23 and July 18, 2002 to determine: rabies-vaccination coverage amongst the owned-dog population; basic dog-population information; and community awareness about rabies. The modified expand programme on immunization cluster-survey method was used to collect information about dog demography and management characteristics. Household knowledge about rabies and sources of rabies information were assessed. Vaccinated dogs were identified from vaccine certificates or owner reports confirmed by vaccinators. Seventy percent (95%CI 62-78) of 364 eligible owned dogs were vaccinated within the 6 months prior to data collection. Of these 255 vaccinated dogs, 44, 21, 13, 17 and 5% were vaccinated through the annual vaccination campaign, veterinary clinics, para-veterinarians, other vaccinators and owners, respectively. Fifty-four percent of households owned dogs. The sex ratio in dogs was 2 males per female; the dog: human ratio was 1: 4.6 with an average of 0.9 dogs per household (1.7 dogs per dog-owning household). Most dogs roamed freely and these were less likely to be vaccinated compared to dogs being kept on premises or on a leash. Almost all households were aware of rabies and the need for dog rabies vaccination as a control method. Seventy-six percent believed that rabies only occurred in summer. There was little awareness about cat rabies amongst households. Vaccination coverage in the total dog population clearly has not yet reached the 80% target level set by Thailand's official rabies-control programme. Improved effectiveness of the owned-dog rabies-vaccination campaigns in each community is needed-perhaps by more community education about dog management or by better management of ownerless dogs.\",\n",
       " 'CONTEXT: It has been hypothesized that multiple-antigen vaccines, such as measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, or aggregated vaccine exposure could lead to immune dysfunction, resulting in nontargeted infectious diseases as a result of an \"overload\" mechanism. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between routinely administered childhood vaccines (Haemophilus influenzae type b; diphtheria-tetanus-inactivated poliovirus; diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-inactivated poliovirus; whole-cell pertussis; measles-mumps-rubella; oral poliovirus) and hospitalization for nontargeted infectious diseases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort comprising all children born in Denmark from 1990 through 2001 (N = 805 206). Longitudinal information was collected on type and number of vaccine doses received and hospitalization with infectious diseases, specifically acute upper respiratory tract infection, viral and bacterial pneumonia, septicemia, viral central nervous system infection, bacterial meningitis, and diarrhea. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate ratios for each type of infectious disease according to vaccination status. RESULTS: During 2,900,463 person-years of follow-up, 84,317 cases of infectious disease hospitalization were identified. Out of 42 possible associations (6 vaccines and 7 infectious disease categories), the only adverse association was for Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine and acute upper respiratory tract infection (rate ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.08 comparing vaccinated participants with unvaccinated participants). This one adverse association of 42 possible outcomes was within the limits of what would be expected by chance alone and the effect was not temporal or dose-response. When considering aggregated vaccine exposure, we found no adverse associations between an increasing number of vaccinations and infectious diseases. CONCLUSION: These results do not support the hypotheses that multiple-antigen vaccines or aggregated vaccine exposure increase the risk of nontargeted infectious disease hospitalization.',\n",
       " 'Vaccine hesitancy is defined as a delay in acceptance, or refusal, of vaccines, despite availability. It is a complex and context specific phenomenon and identified as a global health priority. The \"Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines\" (PACV) questionnaire is a validated tool for identifying vaccine hesitancy. Our aim was to use the PACV to assess vaccine hesitancy and its relationship with reported non-vaccination in an Irish population, for the first time. Our participants were parents or caregivers of children attending general pediatric clinics in a tertiary pediatric hospital in Dublin, Ireland, between September and December 2018. In total, 436 participants completed the questionnaire. 5.5% of our population reported non-vaccination. Human papilloma virus and measles, mumps, rubella vaccines were the most commonly cited vaccines of concern (11.5% and 6.7%, respectively), and autism spectrum disorder was the most commonly side effect of concern (4.3%). Mean PACV score was 26.9 (SD 19.1), with a significant difference between non-vaccinators and vaccinators (53.2 vs 25.3, p<0.001). Safety and efficacy concerns were the major contributor to non-vaccination. 14.4% of our population were vaccine-hesitant using the conventional cut-off score, which increased to 22% when using an optimal cut-off which maximized sensitivity and specificity. The accuracy of the PACV score to identify non-vaccination was good (area under the ROC curve = 0.827), and the optimal cut-off had a high negative predictive value (98.5%).Conclusion: PACV identified reported non-vaccination with high accuracy in our population. It may be useful to screen vaccine-hesitant parents who could benefit from interventions to improve uptake. What is Known: • Vaccine hesitancy is a leading threat to global health, with falls in vaccine uptake associated with disease outbreaks worldwide. • The Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines (PACV) questionnaire is a validated measure of vaccine hesitancy and correlates with non-vaccination in many populations. What is New: • This large study in a pediatric outpatient clinic setting represents the first use of the PACV in a Western European population to assess vaccination hesitancy. • The PACV may be an effective way of screening a pediatric clinic population to identify vaccine-hesitant parents or caregivers for targeted vaccine promotion.',\n",
       " 'The transmission of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) is very high among the Hajj congregation in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Despite recommendations for vaccinations, pilgrims remain at increased risk of RTIs. In this paper we systematically reviewed available studies assessing the uptake and effectiveness of vaccinations against RTIs among Hajj pilgrims and enumerated important demographic factors, if described, associated with vaccine uptake. Of the 42 included studies, 29 reported on the uptake and effectiveness of influenza vaccine among pilgrims, eight studies reported the uptake of other vaccines, notably pneumococcal, diphtheria and bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccines, and the remaining five studies described both influenza and non-influenza vaccines. The uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine ranged from 0.7% to 100% across the study populations, with coverage highest in the elderly and those with pre-existing co-morbidities. The effectiveness of influenza vaccine was variable across studies but was significantly effective against laboratory-confirmed influenza (risk ratio 0.56; 95% CI 0.41-0.75; p <0.001) in pooled metadata from six studies. Uptake of diphtheria and pneumococcal vaccines was low, and the only study reporting pertussis among Hajj pilgrims found the presence of pre-Hajj immunity to be significantly protective against disease. Despite favourable evidence of effectiveness, our review shows variable uptake of vaccines across a number of studies with few data available on the uptake of non-influenza vaccines. Mixed-method studies are needed to gauge knowledge, attitudes and practices of Hajj pilgrims regarding vaccination, and randomized controlled trials are required to confirm the efficacy of vaccines and improve uptake in this vulnerable travelling population.',\n",

       " 'Introduction: Vaccination is a crucial tool for the primary prevention of infectious diseases. Thanks to widespread vaccination, in the last century smallpox has been eradicated, and the Americas and Europe have become polio-free. Areas covered: The aim of our study was to assess vaccination coverage in childhood up to booster preschool age in order to update the analysis on European trends of immunization coverage in the last nine years (2009-2017) and to assess the impact of different national policies on vaccine uptake. Expert opinion: Despite the good results, several EU countries are going through unprecedented outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases due to insufficient coverage. The increase of vaccine hesitancy has made it difficult to reach and maintain high rates of vaccination coverage. Enforcing mandatory vaccinations is one of the strategies adopted by some countries, like Italy and France, to increase coverage. However, each country should find the most suitable way to keep up with vaccination coverages according to own cultural and organizational background.',\n",

The national coverage for the vaccinations given at birth was 97.1%, dropping to 94.3%, 87.7% and 83.6% at ages 3, 5 and 12 months. Among children eligible for the Measles, Mumps and Rubella-vaccinations, the national coverage was 76.9% for children aged 15 months and 64.1% for children aged 4 years, but dropping to 40.9% in the districts. At preschool, the national coverage was 79.9%. Among the 12-year-old, the national coverages of the two vaccinations against Human Papilloma Virus were 88.4% and 71.6%, respectively, and for the three Hepatitis B-vaccinations 89.8%, 84.1% and 69.6%. A subgroup-analysis and test of an SMS-reminder system in Nuuk improved the coverage from 57.8% to 75.5% locally. Overall, we found a high national coverage rate among the newborn in Greenland.

       " 'Modern vaccine history began in the late 18th century with the discovery of smallpox immunization by Edward Jenner. This pivotal step led to substantial progress in prevention of infectious diseases with inactivated vaccines for multiple infectious diseases, including typhoid, plague and cholera. Each advance produced significant decreases in infection-associated morbidity and mortality, thus shaping our modem cultures. As knowledge of microbiology and immunology grew through the 20th century, techniques were developed for cell culture of viruses. This allowed for rapid advances in prevention of polio, varicella, influenza and others. Finally, recent research has led to development of alternative vaccine strategies through use of vectored antigens, pathogen subunits (purified proteins or polysaccharides) or genetically engineered antigens. As the science of vaccinology continues to rapidly evolve, knowledge of the past creates added emphasis on the importance of developing safe and effective strategies for infectious disease prevention in the 21st century.',\n",
       " \"Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine may be associated with excess female deaths. There are few studies of possible nonspecific effects of the DTP-containing vaccine Penta (DTP-hepatitis B-Haemophilus influenzae type b). We therefore investigated whether Penta vaccinations were associated with excess female deaths in rural Bangladesh. Between June 29, 2011 and April 20, 2016, we examined the mortality rates of 7644 children followed between 6\\xa0weeks and 9\\xa0months of age. We analyzed mortality using crude mortality rate ratio (MRR) and age-adjusted MRR (aMRR) from a Cox proportional hazards model. Mortality was analyzed according to sex, number of doses of Penta, and the order in which BCG and Penta were administered. During follow-up, 43 children died. For children who were only BCG vaccinated (BCG-only), the adjusted F/M MRR was 0.47 (0.09-2.48). However, among children who had Penta as their most recent vaccination, the adjusted F/M MRR was 9.91 (1.16-84.44). Hence, the adjusted F/M MRR differed significantly for BCG-only and for Penta as the most recent administered vaccination. Although the mortality rate was low in rural Bangladesh, there was a marked difference between adjusted F/M MRR's for children vaccinated with BCG-only compared with children where Penta was the most recent administered vaccination. Although usually ascribed to differential treatment and access to care, DTP-containing vaccines may be part of the explanation for the excessive female mortality reported in some regions.\",\n",

       " \"Hepatitis B (HepB) is one of the most common infectious diseases affecting over two billion people worldwide. About one third of all HepB cases are in China. In recent years, China made significant efforts to implement a nationwide HepB vaccination program and reduced the number of unvaccinated infants from 30 to 10%. However, many individuals still remain unprotected, particularly those born before 2003. Consequently, a catch-up retroactive vaccination is an important and potentially cost-effective way to reduce HepB prevalence. In this paper, we analyze a game theoretical model of HepB dynamics that incorporates government-provided vaccination at birth coupled with voluntary retroactive vaccinations. Given the uncertainty about the long-term efficacy of the HepB vaccinations, we study several scenarios. When the waning rate is relatively high, we show that this retroactive vaccination should be a necessary component of any HepB eradication effort. When the vaccine offers long-lasting protection, the voluntary retroactive vaccination brings the disease incidence to sufficiently low levels. Also, we find that the optimal vaccination rates are almost independent of the vaccination coverage at birth. Moreover, it is in an individual's self-interest to vaccinate (and potentially re-vaccinate) at a rate just slightly above the vaccine waning rate.\",\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: Decisions regarding which vaccines are funded in the United Kingdom (UK) are increasingly informed by cost-effectiveness analyses. Such analyses use Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) as a measure of effectiveness and assume that QALYs are equal regardless of where and in whom they occur in the population. However, there is increasing debate about whether this QALY approach is appropriate and whether societal preferences for childhood vaccinations should be used to help inform childhood immunisation policy. OBJECTIVE: To gauge the general public's preferences for prioritising certain characteristics of childhood vaccination, to help inform future policy making decisions in the UK. DESIGN: Qualitative design using individual face-to-face interviews, with data analysed using an inductive thematic framework approach. SETTING: Two counties in England, UK. POPULATION: Adult members of the general public were recruited using the Bristol and South Gloucestershire open electoral registers, using gender and deprivation quotas for each area. PARTICIPANTS: 21 members of the public participated in qualitative interviews. RESULTS: The qualitative research identified three major themes and several key attributes that influences participant's opinions about priority setting for childhood vaccinations: (1) population segment (i.e. age group, carer impact and social group), (2) vaccine preventable diseases preferences (i.e. disease severity, disease incidence and declining infection) and (3) risks and benefits associated with childhood vaccinations (i.e. vaccine associated side-effects, herd protection and peace of mind). CONCLUSION: Evidence from this qualitative study suggests that some members of the UK general public have more nuanced views than the health-maximisation approach when considering how childhood vaccines should be prioritised. This is not necessarily captured by the current economic approaches for assessing the benefits from childhood vaccinations in the UK, but is an important area for future research to ensure appropriate decision making.\",\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Knowledge and beliefs about influenza vaccine that differ across racial or ethnic groups may promote racial or ethnic disparities in vaccination. OBJECTIVE: To identify associations between vaccination behavior and personal beliefs about influenza vaccine by race or ethnicity and education levels among the U.S. elderly population. METHODS: Data from a national telephone survey conducted in 2004 were used for this study. Responses for 3875 adults ≥ 65 years of age were analyzed using logistic regression methods. RESULTS: Racial and ethnic differences in beliefs were observed. For example, whites were more likely to believe influenza vaccine is very effective in preventing influenza compared to blacks and Hispanics (whites, 60%; blacks, 47%, and Hispanics, 51%, p<0.01). Among adults who believed the vaccine is very effective, self-reported vaccination was substantially higher across all racial/ethnic groups (whites, 93%; blacks, 76%; Hispanics, 78%) compared to adults who believed the vaccine was only somewhat effective (whites 67%; blacks 61%, Hispanics 61%). Also, vaccination coverage differed by education level and personal beliefs of whites, blacks, and Hispanics. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge and beliefs about influenza vaccine may be important determinants of influenza vaccination among racial/ethnic groups. Strategies to increase coverage should highlight the burden of influenza disease in racial and ethnic populations, the benefits and safety of vaccinations and personal vulnerability to influenza disease if not vaccinated. For greater effectiveness, factors associated with the education levels of some communities may need to be considered when developing or implementing new strategies that target specific racial or ethnic groups.',\n",
       " 'PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to describe the patterns of use of universally recommended adolescent vaccines in the United States. METHODS: We identified 11-year-olds using the MarketScan insurance claims database (2009-2014). Human papillomavirus (HPV), tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap), and meningococcal (MenACWY) vaccination claims were identified using diagnosis and procedure codes. Generalized linear models estimated vaccination incidence rates and correlates of adolescent vaccination and timely vaccination. RESULTS: Among 1,691,223 adolescents, receipt of Tdap (52.1%) and MenACWY (45.8%) vaccinations exceeded receipt of HPV vaccination (18.4%). While both sexes had similar Tdap and MenACWY vaccination proportions, girls received HPV vaccination more frequently than boys (21.9% vs. 15.1%). Adolescents received HPV vaccination later (mean age: 11.8\\xa0years) than Tdap or MenACWY vaccination (mean age: 11.2 years for both). Half of vaccinated adolescents received Tdap and MenACWY vaccination only; however, coadministration with HPV vaccine increased with birth cohort. Western adolescents had the highest incidence rates of HPV vaccination, and Southern adolescents had the lowest. Rural adolescents were less likely than urban adolescents to receive each vaccination except in the Northeast, where they were more likely to receive HPV vaccination (incidence rate ratio: 1.09, 95% confidence interval: 1.2005-1.13). Timely HPV vaccination was associated with female sex, urbanicity, Western residence, and later birth cohort. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccination occurred later than Tdap or MenACWY vaccination and was less frequent in boys and rural adolescents. Girls, Western and urban residents, and younger birth cohorts were more likely to receive timely HPV vaccination. Vaccine coadministration increased over time and may encourage timely and complete vaccination coverage.',\n",

       " \"In this opinion paper, the authors argue that the extension of mandatory immunization of infants up to two years of age from three diseases (diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis) to 11 diseases, introduced in France in January 2018, is not a sustainable response to the challenge of controlling vaccine-preventable diseases. In France in 2017, infant immunization coverage (IC) rates were sufficiently high or increasing (hepatitis B), except for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) and meningococcus C disease. Even if vaccination obligation makes it possible to achieve the MMR IC objectives among infants, communication programmes and supported advice from GPs are essential for the catch-up of susceptible adults to obtain herd immunity. The impact of mandatory immunization on hesitancy remains uncertain, and it contradicts the evolution of the patient's role in the governance of his own health and the principle of autonomy. Numerous studies have shown that interventions and advice from health professionals improve vaccine acceptance. To correct the poor implementation of some vaccination programmes by health professionals, strong communication and resources from health authorities are needed, rather than a retreat towards obligation. Reducing missed opportunities and increasing access to immunization are essential objectives. Finally, an immunization policy based on primary care and a patient-centred approach to each vaccination are more likely to reduce vaccine hesitancy, sustainably.\",\n",

Vaccines have saved millions of lives since their introduction to the public over 200\\xa0years ago. The potential for vaccination reached new heights in the mid-20th century with the development of technologies that expanded the ability to create novel vaccines. Since then, there has been continued technological advancement in vaccine development. The resulting platforms provide the promise for solutions for many infectious diseases, including those that have been with us for decades as well as those just now emerging. Each vaccine platform represents a different technology with a unique set of advantages and challenges, especially when considering manufacturing. Therefore, it is essential to understand each platform as a separate product and process with its specific quality considerations. This review outlines the relevant platforms for developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each.',\n",

Many of these vaccines have also been of significant benefit to civilian populations around the world. The current requirements for force protection include vaccines against endemic disease threats as well as against biological warfare or bioterrorism agents, to include novel or genetically engineered threats.

       " 'Evidence-based decision making (EBDM) is a tool to assess the value of medical interventions by weighing costs and health outcomes that has increasingly been applied to vaccines. However, many of the ethical considerations that support EBDM when used to evaluate therapeutic care do not readily translate to prevention. This mismatch can result in policy decisions that produce unanticipated negative consequences, including public resistance. In its emphasis on quantifiable outcomes, EBDM invokes the ethical principle of rule-utilitarianism, which values the optimal long-run balance of benefit over harm. Vaccines raise a number of competing ethical concerns in ways that individual medical treatments do not. They rely on widespread compliance for effectiveness, which can limit individual autonomy, emphasize population over individual effects, which can obscure the imperative of beneficence to help the vulnerable, require a just allocation process within populations, and sometimes challenge strong social norms. For EBDM to effectively guide vaccine policy makers, such as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in the United States, an ethical foundation is needed that systematically considers all relevant values and transparently places vaccination recommendations in the context of social norms and individual concerns.',\n",

The use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (initially PCV7; more recently PCV13) has led to a dramatic fall in the incidence of conjugate vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease in children. Because PCVs are immunogenic in older adults, the question has arisen as to whether to also use PCVs in this age group. However, PCV vaccination of children has also reduced the incidence of conjugate vaccine-serotype disease in older adults, and so wherever PCVs are used in children, there is no epidemiological reason to vaccinate older adults with PCV. The cost-effectiveness of PPV for older adults has changed wherever PCVs have been used for children, and this needs to be periodically re-evaluated.',\n",
       " \"OBJECTIVES: (1) To identify reasons for non-uptake of hepatitis B vaccine by health care staff; (2) to determine whether fully vaccinated staff are aware of the need to consider booster vaccinations in the future. DESIGN: Semi-structured anonymous questionnaire survey of health care staff. SETTING: Croydon health district, south London. SUBJECTS: 462 health care staff. RESULTS: 300 staff (65%) responded. The reasons given by staff for non-uptake included fear of side-effects or injections, misconceptions about hepatitis B transmission, the alternative use of homeopathic vaccine, pressure of work, difficulties in arranging vaccination, forgetfulness, and 'inertia'. Of the 54 unvaccinated staff, 55.6% believed themselves to be at high risk of contracting hepatitis B as a result of their occupation; 33% of 202 fully vaccinated staff were unaware of the use of booster doses of vaccine to maintain long-term immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The level of awareness and understanding about hepatitis B vaccination of any group of health care staff should not be assumed. A number of specific educational and organisational issues need to be addressed when implementing staff vaccination programmes. Without the use of automatic call-recall systems the long-term success of staff hepatitis B vaccination programmes may be in doubt.\",\n",
       " \"Communicable diseases are leading cause of child mortality in developing and under-developed countries. Public health ministries in states and country allocate a considerable amount of budget every year for vaccination campaigns to control infections. Even third-party agencies such as Gates Foundation, UNDP, GAVI, World Bank, WHO also allocate huge funds to under-developed and developing countries for vaccination programs and disease eliminations. However, economic constraints and current disease prevalence are not enough driving factors for optimal decisions in budget allocations for vaccinations and controlling the disease. In a population under voluntary vaccination campaign, high vaccine coverage cannot be taken for granted, as individuals' free-riding behaviour plays a significant role in achieving the herd immunity level coverage. Individual-level vaccine exemptions and ignoring this important component by the policymakers are key determinants for failure of disease elimination program these days in many under-developed and developing countries. We integrate evolutionary game theory and compartmental model of disease transmission to analyze how individual vaccination choice influence the budget allocations and vice-versa. Our model illustrates that individuals' perceived risk plays an important role in optimal budget allocations to minimize infections. Analyses of our model indicate that the optimal distribution of third-party funds may be very different than usual, especially in multiple populations with contrasting demographic and economic profiles. These findings are certainly useful to public health policymakers and may help to quantify certain parameters in budget allocations to control vaccine-preventable diseases.\",\n",

       " \"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are a serious health problem in the United States, where approximately 18,000 cases are reported each year to the Centers for Disease Control. Even among health care providers, reported vaccination rates have ranged from 17% to 68%. The purpose of this study was to determine the important factors influencing physicians in an academic medical center to receive the HBV vaccination since the introduction of recombinant yeast-derived vaccines. METHODS: The 1282 house staff and attending physicians in a university medical center were surveyed regarding their HBV vaccination history. The characteristics of vaccinated and nonvaccinated physicians and their attitudes and concerns regarding vaccination were compared. RESULTS: Of the 813 physicians who responded, 54.0% had been vaccinated. Vaccination rates varied with level of training, from 91.9% among first- and second-year residents to 32.2% among attending physicians. Although physicians in specialties at higher risk for infection were more likely to have been vaccinated, only 40.0% of pathologists and 51.9% of obstetrician-gynecologists reported having been vaccinated. Using multivariate analysis, we found important demographic predictors of HBV vaccination included physician sex and years since graduation, as well as level of training and specialty. Physicians who had been offered the vaccine were more likely to have been vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that many physicians in an academic medical center, particularly those at an early stage of their training, have received HBV vaccination. Our results suggest that programs offering hepatitis B vaccinations to physicians can be effective in reducing this group's risk of hepatitis B infections. Special efforts may be necessary to reach physicians who have completed their training.\",\n",

       " \"Thanks to vaccines, many people are not exposed to the risks associated with vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). This, however, results in growing popularity of antivaccine movements and affects global and local epidemiological situation. Vaccine hesitancy has become a significant problem not only for epidemiologists but also for practitioners. Fortunately, the hesitant group seems to be vulnerable to intervention, and studies indicate that these patients can be persuaded to undergo vaccinations. The aim of the present study was to determine the factors most strongly affecting vaccination-related attitudes and decisions. An anonymous, self-administered survey consisting of demographic data and single select multiple-choice questions regarding vaccination was conducted. The voluntary study included secondary school pupils, medical and nonmedical students, healthcare professionals, hospital and clinic patients as well as parents. A total of 7950 survey forms were distributed between January 2018 and June 2019 in south-eastern Poland. A total of 6432 respondents (80.2%) completed a questionnaire that was eligible for analysis. The positive attitude toward vaccination was significantly affected by older age, by the fact of obtaining information on vaccinations from a physician, this information's higher quality (assessed in school grade scale), higher level of knowledge on vaccines and by the fact of denying the association between vaccination and autism in children (p < 0.001). The probability of supporting vaccinations was almost eight-fold lower among respondents believing the vaccine-autism relationship. Chance of supporting vaccination doubled in the group with a higher knowledge level. The individuals not provided with expert information on vaccination were twice as often unconvinced. Age, education and having children significantly affected the attitude toward influenza immunization (p < 0.001). Older, better educated respondents and those having children were more positive about vaccinations. The medical community still exert decisive effects on attitudes toward vaccinations. High-quality information provided by them is of great importance. Skillful and competent provision of evidence-based information disproving the myth about vaccine-autism connection and proper education of medical staff is essential in molding positive attitudes toward vaccinations.\",\n",

       " \"In Norway, the incidence of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is higher among 16-19-year-olds than in the general population. Most IMD cases among teenagers are caused by serogroup Y. Since 2011, one dose of meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine (MCV4) has been recommended for teenagers with out-of-pocket payment. The teenagers are usually vaccinated through the school health service at age 18. This study aimed to estimate costs and health gains of introducing MCV4 to Norwegian teenagers through the national immunization program (NIP). A Markov model was used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of universal MCV4 vaccination of either 15-year-olds or 18-years-olds. Occurrences of IMD were simulated from 15 until 23\\xa0years of age. Costs were estimated from a healthcare perspective. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the impact of vaccine price, vaccination uptake, IMD incidence and discount rate. Compared to today's practice of vaccinating 18-year-olds with out-of-pocket payment, introducing MCV4 to 15-year-olds in a NIP-setting, with 90% vaccine uptake and 50% rebate on vaccine price, prevented 3.2 hospitalizations, 0.20 sequelae and 0.47 deaths among 15-23-year-olds, annually. Total costs were reduced by €30,000 and 9.7 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were gained per birth cohort. The probability of cost-effectiveness was 99.0%, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of €86,000/QALY for severe diseases in Norway. Cost-effectiveness was highly dependent on vaccine price. Vaccination of 18-year-olds in a NIP-setting was also cost-effective, but less than NIP-vaccination of 15-year-olds. Introduction of MCV4 to the 15-year-olds in the Norwegian NIP is likely to be cost-effective given a rebate on the vaccine price.\",\n",
       " 'The vaccination status was investigated in 1482 patients between the ages of 1 and 14 years admitted to hospital with scarlet fever. Most of the patients were vaccinated against tuberculosis (97.7%), diphtheria, tetanus and whooping-cough (95.3%) and poliomyelitis (94.1%), relatively few against measles (21.1%) and very few indeed against mumps (0.7%) and tick-borne encephalitis (1.9%). The booster vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria had been omitted in more than 40%. Although the beneficial results of vaccination against tuberculosis, diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus and poliomyelitis remained more or less the same, the tendency towards vaccination did not spread as might have been anticipated. On the contrary, the extent of vaccination decreased, especially during the past years. In the same way the tendency towards vaccination against measles showed a sudden slowing down after a period of rapid increase. This implies that vaccination of children does not tend towards perfection. The vaccination rates differ widely between foreign children living in Vienna and natives. Although the foreigners show a similar vaccination distribution pattern as the natives, the numbers of unvaccinated children are much higher.',\n",
       " 'Pregnant women are a World Health Organization (WHO) priority group for influenza vaccination, but evidence of effectiveness and safety for pregnant women comes from observational studies, which are notoriously prone to confounding by indication and healthy-vaccinee bias. The latter type of bias leads to an overestimation of the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine, which may be what occurs in pregnant women. Indeed, better educated women with healthier behaviors and who seek better medical care may be more adherent to vaccinations recommended by doctors, scientific societies and health authorities. Therefore, it is fundamental to obtain information about vaccine effectiveness and safety from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Cochrane reviews have identified only one RCT with \"low risk of bias\". Its results were unclear in terms of maternal, perinatal, and infant deaths and hospitalization, and showed a Number Needed to Vaccine (NNV) of 55 for mothers, with an excess of local adverse effects. A Cochrane review concluded that the inactivated influenza vaccine provides pregnant women with uncertain or very limited protection against influenza-like illnesses and influenza. Some observational studies have suggested possible adverse effects of the inflammation following the vaccination. Consistent with the Cochrane reviewers\\' conclusions, further trials for influenza vaccines with appropriate study designs and comparison groups are required before promoting universal seasonal influenza vaccinations of pregnant women. Meanwhile, vaccination in second to third trimester should be offered while communicating the uncertainties that still exist, promoting informed choices. Vaccination in the first trimester is debatable and debated. This does not mean leaving women defenseless; many other useful behavioral and environmental measures can reduce infectious disease.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Some believe that vaccinating young women against human papillomavirus (HPV) will increase their risky behavior. In more formal terms, vaccination lowers risk perception, and people compensate for their lower perceived risk by reducing other preventive behaviors. PURPOSE: We test several predictions from the risk compensation hypothesis in the context of vaccination behavior. METHODS: We obtained a random sample of adults (N=705), interviewing them by phone just as the Lyme disease vaccine first became available to the public and again 18 months later. Analyses controlled for age, sex, education, and race. RESULTS: Vaccinated respondents were less likely to continue engaging in two of five protective behaviors after vaccination. The frequency of these protective behaviors did not dip below that among the unvaccinated respondents. CONCLUSIONS: We found some evidence of regression (protective behaviors dropping, after vaccination, to levels reported by the unvaccinated cohort). However, we did not find disinhibition (exceeding the risk taking of the unvaccinated cohort), the greater threat to public health. Although we will not know for several years what effect HPV vaccination has on other behaviors, if any, data on other vaccinations can offer critically important information in the interim.',\n",
       " 'In many countries of the developing world village poultry play a vital role in the rural economy, providing a source of protein and valuable income with relatively small investments. In almost all areas in which village poultry are raised Newcastle disease (ND) is identified as one of the biggest causes of poultry loss, this is often coupled with a lack of knowledge of poultry management practices. Inexpensive and effective vaccines are available that are suitable for use in rural village environments, but in many areas service providers and reliable structures for delivery remain an obstacle to uptake of vaccines. To overcome this, GALVmed has implemented a network for vaccine distribution in which individuals in the villages are trained as vaccinators. The vaccinators purchase ND vaccines from local agro-veterinary stores and sell single doses at market determined prices. Implementation of these networks was preceded by a programme of smallholder sensitisation to increase awareness of diseases and flock management practices. Here we present analysis of the impacts of this scheme on village poultry production. We compare the results of a baseline survey carried out before implementation of the networks, with the results of a survey 16-24 months following implementation. We present results in terms of the uptake of ND vaccine, flock size, consumption of poultry meat, and poultry sales from Gairo district in Tanzania, Mayurbhanj district in India and Banke district in Nepal. In all areas, there was a significant increase in the numbers of flocks that were using ND vaccines, with over 75% uptake in all areas, reaching 98% in India. In all areas flock sizes doubled, the numbers of eggs that were set for hatching and that hatched increased by 25-50% and there was an increase in the frequency with which chicken meat was consumed and chickens were sold. Additionally, farmers reported fewer ND outbreaks, but this is prone to reporting bias and so improvements in production cannot be categorically ascribed to ND vaccination. These results have shown that establishing a market driven approach for the distribution of ND vaccines and community sensitisation on poultry husbandry practices results in a high rate of uptake of the vaccines. The results also suggest a reduction in the number of ND outbreaks and improvements to the livelihoods of rural smallholders.',\n",

In-feed application of maternal antibodies from vaccinated hens was shown to confer protection of broilers against Campylobacter infection. Here, it was investigated if these vaccines can be used to protect broilers against Campylobacter infection after in ovo vaccination. Embryos were immunized in ovo at day 18 with a bacterin or a subunit vaccine and at 19 D post hatch, these birds were inoculated with C. jejuni according to a seeder model. Quantification of C. jejuni in the broilers cecal content showed that the in ovo vaccinated birds were not protected against C. jejuni infection. Quantification of blood anti-Campylobacter antibody titers did not show any induction of Campylobacter-specific serological response in the vaccinated birds, which may explain the lack of protection in the vaccinated chicks.',\n",
       " 'The exponential growth in vaccine research over the last decade, in which many infectious diseases now appear to be amenable to prevention through immunization, is built upon three factors: first, a richer understanding of the immune response (in particular, cellular immunity), second, a greater finesse in understanding the molecular biology of pathogenicity, and third, an expanding use of genetic engineering techniques either to create micro-organisms of greatly attenuated virulence that may be used as vaccines, or to sequence, and express, potential vaccine antigens. With respect to vaccines composed of purified antigens, parallel work is underway to develop immuno-modulating agents (adjuvants) that will selectively and safely induce the necessary immune response. Finally, within this plethora of vaccine candidates, vaccinologists are devoting much effort to alternatives to immunization via injection, such as administration of a vaccine through the mucosal route (e.g., oral, intranasal, intravaginal, etc.), through the transcutaneous route, and even by expression of vaccine antigens in edible fruits and vegetables.',\n",

       " \"INTRODUCTION: Heterogeneous coverage threatens to compromise the effectiveness of immunization programs in Zambia. Demand-creation initiatives are needed to address this; however, there is incomplete understanding of why vaccine coverage is suboptimal. We investigated overarching perceptions on vaccine acceptability, hesitancy, and accessibility at three informal settlements in Lusaka, Zambia. METHODS: Nested within a cholera vaccination uptake study, we sought to understand overarching perceptions on vaccines' hesitancy in three informal settlements in Lusaka, Zambia. We conducted 48 focus group discussions with a convenience sample of laypersons, lay healthcare workers, neighbourhood health committee members and vaccinators. RESULTS: Both laypersons and community-based health actors reported high vaccine acceptance though several sources of hesitancy were reported. Traditional remedies, alcohol use and religious beliefs emerged as drivers of vaccine hesitancy, likely reinforced by a background of distrust towards western medicine. Also mentioned were previous adverse events, fear of injections and low perceived need for immunization. Limited understanding of how vaccines work and overlapping local terms for vaccine and other medical concepts created confusion and inaccurate views and expectations. Some reported refusing injections to avoid pain and perceived risk of infection. Discussants emphasised the importance of education and preferred mobile immunization campaigns, with weekend to reach those with poor access and delivered by a combination of professional and volunteer workers. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine hesitancy in Zambia is underpinned by many factors including personal experiences with vaccinations, alternative belief models, limited knowledge, deep misunderstanding about how vaccines work, and barriers to access. To overcome these, community-driven models that incorporate factual communication by professionals and operate outside of traditional hours, may help. Better research to understand community preferences for vaccine uptake could inform interventions to improve immunization coverage in Zambia.\",\n",
       " 'Low vaccination rates with pneumococcal vaccine in elderly persons in Japan are thought to be related to low levels of public subsidy. To identify strategies to increase future pneumococcal vaccination rates, we examined the relationship between public subsidies and vaccination rates. We also investigated the influence of free vaccinations after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake on vaccination rates in the three Tohoku prefectures of Japan. We surveyed a total of 1742 municipalities in Japan about whether public subsidies were available and their monetary amount. Vaccination rates with the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine were calculated as the \"cumulative amount shipped to each municipality divided by the population aged ≥65 years.\" There were no subsidies in 773 municipalities (44.4%). In those municipalities with public subsidies, larger subsidies were significantly associated with elevated vaccination rates (p < 0.0001). Compared to a mean vaccination rate of 25.4% throughout Japan, the vaccination rate was 52.1% in municipalities where the full cost was subsidized. The three prefectures (Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima) most affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake ranked as the top three prefectures for vaccination rates in Japan, presumably as a result of the free vaccination campaign for disaster victims. Our findings show that public subsidies play an important role in increasing the vaccination rate. The free vaccinations given to disaster victims after the Great East Japan Earthquake helped to achieve extremely high vaccination rates in the three Tohoku prefectures. We suggest that such public subsidies should be promoted throughout Japan.',\n",

The c-DNA corresponding to the glycoprotein of the ERA strain of rabies virus has been inserted into the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of the vaccinia virus (Copenhagen strain). The efficacy of this recombinant strain was tested by the oral route, primarily in foxes. The duration of immunity conferred by the VVTGg RAB, a minimum of 12 months in cubs and 18 months in adult animals, corresponds to the length of protection required for fox vaccination in the field. VVTGg RAB innocuity was tested in foxes and in domestic animals as well as in numerous wild animal species that could compete with the red fox in consuming vaccine baits in Europe. During a minimum of 28 days post vaccination, neither clinical signs nor lesions were observed in any of the vaccinated animals. Moreover no transmission of immunizing amounts of the recombinant occurred in the red fox or the other species tested. To study the stability of the vaccine strain, baits containing the vaccine were placed in the field. Despite considerable variations of environmental temperatures, the VVTGg RAB titre remained stable after one month in the field. Since all the baits are taken within one month, it can be assumed that most of the animals taking the baits are effectively vaccinated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",

This is largely because of low vaccine coverage and interference by maternally derived antibodies. To overcome these problems, new vaccination strategies and novel generations of vaccines should be developed. Among the approaches presently considered are the use of different routes of application of new attenuated measles and recombinant viruses and of viral subunits presented with new adjuvant systems. To evaluate the potential of these new approaches in terms of protective mechanisms, efficacy, and safety, a recently evaluated macaque model of measles virus infection may be expected to be a potent tool.',\n",

Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire in patients attending at an academic rheumatology clinic. If vaccination was not received, the reason was established. RESULTS: Ninety-eight out of a total of 103 patients surveyed met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated: 72.4% had received the influenza vaccination in the past year encompassing a period of 2017-2019. Of the 27.6% who did not, the most common chosen reason was personal preference not to get vaccinated (55.6%). Regarding HZ, 18.4% had received vaccination. Of the 2 available types of vaccines, more participants received Zostavax (66.7%) as compared to Shringrix (33.3%).

       " 'There are two types of classical swine fever vaccines available: the classical live and the recently developed E2 subunit vaccines. The live Chinese strain vaccine is the most widely used. After a single vaccination, it confers solid immunity within a few days that appears to persist lifelong. The E2 subunit vaccine induces immunity from approximately 10-14 days after a single vaccination. The immunity may persist for more than a year, but is then not complete. The Chinese strain vaccine may establish a strong herd immunity 1-2 weeks earlier than the E2 vaccine. The ability of the Chinese vaccine strain to prevent congenital infection has not been reported, but the E2 subunit vaccine does not induce complete protection against congenital infection. Immunological mechanisms that underlie the protective immunity are still to be elucidated. Both types of vaccine are considered to be safe. A great advantage of the E2 subunit vaccine is that it allows differentiation of infected pigs from vaccinated pigs and is referred to as a DIVA vaccine. However, the companion diagnostic E(rns) ELISA to actually make that differentiation should be improved. Many approaches to develop novel vaccines have been described, but none of these is likely to result in a new DIVA vaccine reaching the market in the next 5-10 years. Countries where classical swine fever is endemic can best control the infection by systematic vaccination campaigns, accompanied by the normal diagnostic procedures and control measures. Oral vaccination of wild boar may contribute to lowering the incidence of classical swine fever, and consequently diminishing the threat of virus introduction into domestic pigs. Free countries should not vaccinate and should be highly alert to rapidly diagnose any new outbreak. Once a new introduction of classical swine fever virus in dense pig areas has been confirmed, an emergency vaccination programme should be immediately instituted, for maximum benefit. The question is whether the time is ripe to seriously consider global eradication of classical swine fever virus.',\n",

       " \"To increase vaccination coverage, it is essential to understand the vaccine decision-making process. High population coverage is required to obtain herd immunity and to protect vulnerable groups in terms of age (e.g. the very young) or health (e.g. immunodeficiency). Vaccine confidence and coverage in South Africa are relatively low, opening the window for sustained outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in a country facing one of the most severe HIV epidemics in the world. To capture the vaccine-related decision-making process in South Africa, we performed a discrete choice experiment with 1200 participants in December 2017. We asked for their preferences with respect to (1) vaccine effectiveness, (2) vaccine-preventable burden of disease, (3) accessibility of the vaccine in terms of co-payment and prescription requirements, (4) frequency of mild vaccine-related side-effects, (5) population vaccination coverage and (6) local vaccination coverage. We distinguished between decision-making for vaccines administered to the participant, and for vaccines administered to their youngest child. We analyzed the data for each of these groups using a panel mixed logit model and found similar results for decisions to vaccinate oneself or one's child. Vaccine effectiveness was the most important attribute followed by population coverage and burden of disease. Local coverage and accessibility were also important determinants of vaccination behavior, but to a lesser extent. Regarding population and local coverage, we observed a positive effect on vaccine utility indicating the potential of peer influence. As such, social normative influence could be exploited to increase vaccination confidence and coverage. With respect to vaccine-preventable burden of the disease, the marginal utilities showed disease severity to be more important than frequency of disease. Policymakers and health care workers should stress the effectiveness of vaccines together with the severity of vaccine-preventable diseases.\",\n",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 1045 self-reported questionnaires were given to medical students of Warsaw Medical University (n = 502), the Faculty of Medicine of Strasbourg University (n = 371) and Teheran University of Medical Sciences (n = 172). In France, students working in a hospital can be vaccinated free of charge. In Poland and Iran students are required to pay for the vaccine and have to arrange the administration of the vaccine on their own. RESULTS: Vaccination of students during the year of the study time was generally infrequent: the highest was in Strasbourg 29.7%; it was lower in Warsaw 15.2%, and lowest in Teheran at 4.7%. Similarly, 60% of medical students in Strasbourg, 65% of students in Warsaw and 86% of students in Teheran have never been vaccinated. The percentage of students knowing that they belong to the group of people that have strong indications for being vaccinated was 78% in Strasbourg, 48% in Warsaw and 40% in Teheran. The main reasons for obtaining a shot, cited by students, were to protect from influenza and the fear of disease sequelae. The most important reasons for not being vaccinated were laziness, lack of time, and also lack of knowledge of the indications in favor of being vaccinated. Being vaccinated at least once in the past is the most important predictor of the vaccination in the current season. CONCLUSIONS: Few medical students in all of the examined countries are immunized against influenza. Data indicate that providing access to free vaccinations, although very important, cannot alone solve the problem. Strengthening educational efforts seems crucial, although no immediate effects should be expected due to remarkable inertia. Influencing attitudes at an earlier stage can be more advantageous.',\n",
       " 'Although vaccination is one of the most cost-effective health care interventions, under-vaccination and variation in coverage rates lower than policy targets is rising in developed countries, partly due to concerns about vaccination value and benefits. By merging various antigens into a single product, combination vaccines represent a valuable tool to mitigate the burden associated with the numerous injections needed to protect against vaccine preventable infectious diseases and increase coverage rate, possibly through various behavioral mechanisms which have yet to be fully explored. Beyond their cost-effectiveness in protecting against more diseases with fewer injections, combination vaccines also have several other benefits, for children, their parents/carers, as well as for the health system and the population as a whole. The objectives of this review are to identify and illustrate the value of combination vaccines for childhood immunization. Evidence was classified into 2 groups: benefits for society and benefits for public health and healthcare systems. This article also highlights the value of innovation and challenges of combination vaccine development as well as the need for an increased number of suppliers to mitigate the impact of any potential vaccine shortage. Increasing public confidence in vaccines and combination vaccines is also critical to fully exploit their benefits.',\n",
       " 'In times of declining immunization rates among children in many countries and an increasing threat of potentially vaccine-preventable diseases, there is a strong need for new strategies to improve trust in vaccinations and acceptance of recommendations, especially in parents of infants and children. A survey to evaluate vaccination acceptance has been conducted in Vienna, Austria, based on a US CDC survey, applying a cross-sectional approach with districts and public as well as private kindergartens and preschools as selection base. The survey aimed to investigate the impact of parent satisfaction with, and overall trust in the physician on vaccine acceptance, as well as the impact of quality and completeness of safety information delivered during the vaccination consultation. Overall 1101 parents, predominantly (84.2%) mothers, participated in the survey. The majority (82.7%) of participants had a generally positive view concerning childhood vaccination. However, 25.1% refused at least one of the recommended vaccinations. In multivariate analysis, confidence in vaccinations was significantly influenced by education (lower confidence at higher levels of education), gender (higher confidence in females), and positively associated with trust in physician, smooth vaccination procedure, and information about vaccine risks. Similar results were obtained for compliance with recommended vaccinations with information about vaccine benefits being the most important predictor. This large survey indicates an important role of the physician in communicating balanced information about benefits and risks associated with childhood vaccinations. A trustworthy parent-physician relationship is crucial for vaccination decisions of parents.',\n",
       " 'Adolescents refer to individuals in the age group 10 to 19 years. Vaccination of people in this age group offers an opportunity to catch-up on vaccinations missed during childhood, boost waning immunity from childhood vaccines, and provide primary immunity with new vaccines. Vaccination coverage among adolescents is suboptimal worldwide, especially in African countries, and it is unclear which interventions could improve the situation. We focus this commentary on a recent Cochrane review that assessed the effects of interventions to increase vaccination coverage among adolescents. The authors conducted a comprehensive search in multiple peer-reviewed and grey literature databases and identified 16 eligible studies, mostly conducted in high-income countries. The most effective interventions for improving adolescent vaccination coverage included: education of adolescents and their parents about the importance of vaccinations; mandatory vaccination, whereby government enacts laws requiring adolescents to be vaccinated as a pre-condition for school enrolment; and providing a complementary package of educational interventions to adolescents and their parents and healthcare workers. Implementing the evidence from this review would improve adolescent vaccination coverage in Africa. However, given that only one eligible study was conducted in an African country, there is need for African researchers to invest on research in this topic.',\n",
       " 'In establishing standards of quality for vaccines used in vaccination programmes, it is necessary to protect the recipients without demanding unnecessarily high specifications and standards of purity.

Funds will be needed to encourage research and local manufacture, and internationally accepted procedures of quality assurance must be established.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Most vaccines in the Expanded Program on Immunization are universal childhood vaccines (eg, measles and rotavirus vaccines). Other vaccines such as typhoid conjugate (TCV) and Japanese encephalitis vaccines are risk based and only used in countries where populations are at risk of these diseases. However, strategies to introduce risk-based vaccines are becoming complex due to increasing intracountry variability in disease incidence. There is a need to assess whether subnational vaccine strategies are appropriate. CRITERIA, CHALLENGES, AND BENEFITS: Subnational strategies consider intracountry heterogeneous risk and prioritize vaccination only in those areas that are at risk; there is no intent to introduce the vaccine nationally. The following variables should be considered to determine appropriateness of subnational strategies: disease burden, outbreak potential, treatment availability and costs, cost-effectiveness, and availability of other preventive interventions. We propose criteria for each variable and use a hypothetical country considering TCV introduction to show how criteria are applied to determine if a subnational strategy is appropriate. Challenges include granularity of disease-burden data, political challenges of vaccinating only a portion of a population, and potentially higher costs of introduction. Benefits include targeted reduction of disease burden, increased equity for marginalized populations, and progress on development goals. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of perfect information at the national level, adopting a subnational vaccine strategy can provide country decision makers with an alternative to national vaccine introduction. Given the changing nature of communicable disease burden, subnational vaccination may be a tool to effectively avert mortality and morbidity while maximizing the use of available health and financial resources.',\n",

       " 'The Consistency Approach offers the possibility of reducing the number of animals used for a potency test. However, it is critical to assess the effect that such reduction may have on assay performance. Consistency of production, sometimes referred to as consistency of manufacture or manufacturing, is an old concept implicit in regulation, which aims to ensure the uninterrupted release of safe and effective products. Consistency of manufacture can be described in terms of process capability, or the ability of a process to produce output within specification limits. For example, the standard method for potency testing of inactivated rabies vaccines is a multiple-dilution vaccination challenge test in mice that gives a quantitative, although highly variable estimate. On the other hand, a single-dilution test that does not give a quantitative estimate, but rather shows if the vaccine meets the specification has been proposed. This simplified test can lead to a considerable reduction in the number of animals used. However, traditional indices of process capability assume that the output population (potency values) is normally distributed, which clearly is not the case for the simplified approach. Appropriate computation of capability indices for the latter case will require special statistical considerations.',\n",
       " 'The mucosal administration of vaccines is an area currently receiving a high level of interest due to potential advantages offered by this technique. These advantages include the ability to administer vaccines without need for needles, thus improving patient compliance with vaccination schedules, and the capacity to induce immune responses capable of preventing infections at the site of acquisition. Despite these advantages a number of limitations exist which currently inhibit our ability to successfully develop new mucosal vaccines. As such, much research is currently focused on developing new adjuvants and delivery systems to overcome these difficulties. However, despite high levels of interest in this area, relatively few mucosal vaccine candidates have successfully progressed to human clinical trials. In the review that follows, we aim to provide the reader with an overview of the immune system with respect to induction of mucosal immune responses. Furthermore, the review provides an overview of a number of microbial (bacterial toxins, CpG DNA, cytokines/chemokines, live vectors, and virus like particles) and synthetic (microspheres, liposomes, and lipopeptides) strategies that have been investigated as adjuvants or delivery systems for mucosal vaccine development, with a focus on the delivery of vaccines via the oral route.',\n",
       " 'Quantified in the study are the extent of missed opportunities for immunization and the potential increases in vaccination coverage and timeliness that could be achieved by using all health centre visits to administer childhood vaccinations in the Central African Republic. The data were collected during a national vaccination coverage survey of 642 children aged 12-23 months from three areas: rural, urban, and the capital, Bangui. Dates of all vaccination visits and other health centre visits were obtained from combined vaccination/health cards. Nationwide, 70% of all opportunities for valid measles vaccination were missed. Of these, 28% occurred at visits when at least one vaccine was given, while 72% occurred at other health centre visits. If there had been no missed opportunities to administer all vaccinations due when at least one vaccine was given, the coverage would have increased from 53% to 67% for the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus series, from 54% to 70% for measles, and from 34% to 59% for all antigens. If there had been no missed opportunities at any visit, the corresponding increases would have been to 70%, 76%, and 65%. For measles, 46% of the potential increase depends on recognizing that an earlier dose of the vaccine was invalid and on revaccinating. Days-at-risk for measles (after the age of 270 days) would have been reduced by a mean of 74 days per subject with a health card had no opportunities been missed. The method used serves as a valuable adjunct to evaluations of missed opportunities based on exit interviews at health facilities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",
       " \"Public health officials warn that the greatest barrier to widespread vaccination against Covid-19 will not be scientific or technical, but the considerable public hesitancy to take a novel vaccine. Understanding the factors that influence vaccine acceptance is critical to informing public health campaigns aiming to combat public fears and ensure broad uptake. Employing a conjoint experiment embedded on an online survey of almost 2,000 adult Americans, we show that the effects of seven vaccine attributes on subjects' willingness to vaccinate vary significantly across subgroups. Vaccine efficacy was significantly more influential on vaccine acceptance among whites than among Blacks, while bringing a vaccine to market under a Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization had a stronger adverse effect on willingness to vaccinate among older Americans and women. Democrats were more sensitive to vaccine efficacy than Republicans, and both groups responded differently to various endorsements of the vaccine. We also explored whether past flu vaccination history, attitudes toward general vaccine safety, and personal contact with severe cases of Covid-19 can explain variation in group vaccination hesitancy. Many subgroups that exhibit the greatest Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy did not report significantly lower frequencies of flu vaccination. Several groups that exhibited greater Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy also reported greater concerns about vaccine safety generally, but others did not. Finally, subgroup variation in reported personal contact with severe cases of Covid-19 did not strongly match subgroup variation in vaccine acceptance.\",\n",
       " 'The epidemic of poliomyelitis which occurred in Israel in 1958 among a population a large proportion of which had received inactivated Salk-type vaccine aroused great interest. This was the first time a vaccinated infant population had been exposed to a severe epidemic and thus afforded the first opportunity to determine whether or not vaccination afforded a high degree of protection in this age-group. The authors report on the observations made.While the vaccine conferred some protection, this was not of so high a degree as had been expected from experience elsewhere in older children. This partial failure may be explained in part by the use in the earlier vaccination campaigns of vaccines of lower potency than is now current and perhaps by the fact that many vaccinations were performed intradermally.No very exact measure of the protection conferred can be given. For some groups the figures are too small for statistical validity; for others, it is not possible to distinguish between the effect of vaccine and that of age, the latter possibly being the more important factor.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Decision-makers may consider vaccinating girls and boys with different HPV vaccines to benefit from their respective strengths; the quadrivalent (HPV4) prevents anogenital warts (AGW) whilst the bivalent (HPV2) may confer greater cross-protection. We compared, to a girls-only vaccination program with HPV4, the impact of vaccinating: 1) both genders with HPV4, and 2) boys with HPV4 and girls with HPV2. METHODS: We used an individual-based transmission-dynamic model of heterosexual HPV infection and diseases. Our base-case scenario assumed lifelong efficacy of 100% against vaccine types, and 46,29,8,18,6% and 77,43,79,8,0% efficacy against HPV-31,-33,-45,-52,-58 for HPV4 and HPV2, respectively. RESULTS: Assuming 70% vaccination coverage and lifelong cross-protection, vaccinating boys has little additional benefit on AGW prevention, irrespective of the vaccine used for girls. Furthermore, using HPV4 for boys and HPV2 for girls produces greater incremental reductions in SCC incidence than using HPV4 for both genders (12 vs 7 percentage points). At 50% vaccination coverage, vaccinating boys produces incremental reductions in AGW of 17 percentage points if both genders are vaccinated with HPV4, but increases female incidence by 16 percentage points if girls are switched to HPV2 (heterosexual male incidence is incrementally reduced by 24 percentage points in both scenarios). Higher incremental reductions in SCC incidence are predicted when vaccinating boys with HPV4 and girls with HPV2 versus vaccinating both genders with HPV4 (16 vs 12 percentage points). Results are sensitive to vaccination coverage and the relative duration of protection of the vaccines. CONCLUSION: Vaccinating girls with HPV2 and boys with HPV4 can optimize SCC prevention if HPV2 has higher/longer cross-protection, but can increase AGW incidence if vaccination coverage is low among boys.',\n",

       " 'In order to gather a global picture of vaccine hesitancy and whether/how it is changing, an analysis was undertaken to review three years of data available as of June 2017 from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Report Form (JRF) to determine the reported rate of vaccine hesitancy across the globe, the cited reasons for hesitancy, if these varied by country income level and/or by WHO region and whether these reasons were based upon an assessment. The reported reasons were classified using the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization matrix of hesitancy determinants (www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2014/october/SAGE_working_group_revised_report_vaccine_hesitancy.pdf). Hesitancy was common, reported by >90% of countries. The list of cited reasons was long and covered 22 of 23 WHO determinants matrix categories. Even the most frequently cited category, risk- benefit (scientific evidence e.g. vaccine safety concerns), accounted for less than one quarter of all reasons cited. The reasons varied by country income level, by WHO region and over time and within a country. Thus based upon this JRF data, across the globe countries appear to understand the SAGE vaccine hesitancy definition and use it to report reasons for hesitancy. However, the rigour of the cited reasons could be improved as only just over 1/3 of countries reported that their reasons were assessment based, the rest were opinion based. With respect to any assessment in the previous five years, upper middle income countries were the least likely to have done an assessment. These analyses provided some of the evidence for the 2017 Assessment Report of the Global Vaccine Action Plan recommendation that each country develop a strategy to increase acceptance and demand for vaccination, which should include ongoing community engagement and trust-building, active hesitancy prevention, regular national assessment of vaccine concerns, and crisis response planning (www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2017/october/1_GVAP_Assessment_report_web_version.pdf).',\n",

       " 'Of all the branches of modern medicine, vaccinology can claim to be the one that has contributed most to the relief of human misery and the spectacular increase in life expectancy in the last two centuries. It is the only science that has eradicated an infectious disease-smallpox-responsible for 8-20% of all deaths in several European countries in the 18th century. Other disabling and lethal diseases, like poliomyelitis and measles, are targeted for eradication. Currently, it is estimated that immunization saves the lives of 3 million children a year but 2 million more lives could be saved by existing vaccines. The success of vaccines in controlling and eliminating diseases has, paradoxically, been the cause of a revival of the anti-vaccination movement which in the absence, in developed countries, of many erstwhile common infectious diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis, measles, rubella and mumps has come to believe that vaccination is not only no longer necessary but is even dangerous. This is because it accepts, as \"reactions\", any untoward health event that occurs after administration of a vaccine. Most vaccine \"reactions\", therefore, appear to be more frequent than vaccine-preventable diseases. Public Health Authorities, aware of the great value of vaccines to society, are facing an uphill battle to get them accepted by a growing proportion of so-called educated minorities, thus endangering disease elimination. Other developments, in the last two decades, that have hampered vaccine usage have been the exploding costs of research, development and manufacture of new vaccines and the emphasis still placed on therapy in preference to prevention in medicine. This has led to the erroneous perception that vaccines are expensive although they are, in most cases, more cost-effective than the popular wait-see-treat approach. A favorable trend for vaccinology has been fueled by recent major breakthroughs in the sciences of immunology, molecular biology, genomics, proteomics, physico-chemistry and computers that promise a bright future for prevention, not only of acute infectious diseases, but also treatment of conditions like chronic infections, allergy, auto-immune diseases and cancer where some malfunctioning of the immune system is thought to play a part. Vaccines are being made more user-friendly by the development of combined vaccines and less painful and invasive inoculation techniques than the traditional syringe and needle. Recent new initiatives, like the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI),which are gathering new sources of funding for vaccination, should be beneficial for vaccinology.',\n",

There were no post-vaccination reactions recorded in calves vaccinated with 10 times the recommended dose, under semi-field conditions. After vaccination 53.9% of the vaccinates developed fever over 39.5 degrees C that lasted for a few days, but none developed clinical theileriosis or required drug treatment during the 3-week follow-up. The numbers of animals in which piroplasms were detected before and after vaccination were similar (7.15% and 7.25%, respectively), indicating previous exposure to T. annulata tick infection. Following vaccination none of the 241 pregnant cows aborted. Milk production during 30-45 days was similar in non-vaccinated and vaccinated cows, at about 5.2-5.9L/day.

       " 'OBJECTIVE: To determine the sample size necessary to evaluate the efficacy of a vaccine in a population. PROCEDURE: An equation was coded into a computer spreadsheet to compare the traditional sample size calculation with that needed when evaluating the efficacy of a vaccine applied in a population. RESULTS: The traditional approach used to conservatively estimate sample size necessary to detect a given difference in group proportions potentially greatly underestimates the number of animals needed for vaccine efficacy (VE) trials. In VE trials, it is necessary to estimate the effect of population-level vaccination prior to estimating sample size. In VE trials, as incidence proportion in the population or herd decreases or VE decreases, necessary sample size increases. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In designing a clinical or field trial, such as one to evaluate the efficacy of a vaccine against an infectious disease in a population, one needs to approach sample size calculations in a nontraditional manner. The proportion of the population vaccinated, disease transmission dynamics, and VE will affect the incidence in the nonvaccinated and vaccinated groups and, hence, sample size. Thus, estimation of the effect of the vaccination on the population must be made prior to calculating sample size. Otherwise, sample size and the power to identify VE will be insufficient.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: In 2013, the annual influenza immunisation programme in England was extended to children to reduce the burden of influenza, but uptake was sub-optimal at 53.2%. AIM: To explore the reasons some parents decided not to vaccinate their child against influenza as part of the pilot programme offered in schools. METHODS: Cross-sectional qualitative study conducted between February and July 2015. 913 parents whose children were not vaccinated against influenza in the school pilots in West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester, England, were asked to comment on their reasons for non-vaccination and invited to take part in a semi-structured interview. 138 parents returned response forms, of which 38 were eligible and interested in participating and 25 were interviewed. Interview transcripts were coded by theme in NVivo. RESULTS: A third of parents who returned response forms had either vaccinated their child elsewhere, intended to have them vaccinated, or had not vaccinated them due to medical reasons (valid or perceived). Most interviewees were not convinced of the need to vaccinate their child against influenza. Parents expressed concerns about influenza vaccine effectiveness and vaccine side effects. Several parents interviewed declined the vaccine for faith reasons due to the presence of porcine gelatine in the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: To significantly decrease the burden of influenza in England, influenza vaccination coverage in children needs to be >60%. Hence, it is important to understand the reasons why parents are not vaccinating their children, and to tailor the communication and immunisation programme accordingly. Our finding that a third of parents, who did not consent to their child being vaccinated as part of the school programme, had actually vaccinated their child elsewhere, intended to have their child vaccinated, or had not vaccinated them due to medical reasons, illustrates the importance of including additional questions or data sources when investigating under-vaccination.',\n",

The acute septicemic form can rapidly cause death in bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus. The ultimate goals of this long-term study were the development and identification of the most effective vaccination protocol against clinical erysipelas in T. truncatus using a commercially available swine vaccine, and to determine whether there is a need for a semi-annual vaccination versus an annual vaccination. The present study concentrated on the immunization of a dolphin population (7 wild-born and 22 captive-born individuals) with 2 swine vaccines, the European 'Eurovac Ery®' vaccine and the American 'ER Bac Plus®' vaccine, and immunological profile results over a 20-yr time period. The general protocol was a primo-vaccination (between 3 and 7 mo of age for calves) with or without a booster 1 mo post primo-vaccination and either annual or semi-annual vaccination thereafter. Sera were collected prior to vaccination, 2 wk post-vaccination and monthly. A dolphin-specific ELISA was developed to analyze the erysipelas-specific antibody response of vaccinated animals. The final ELISA results (n = 1362 samples from 29 animals at pre- and post-vaccination time) suggest that (1) there is a significant difference in antibody levels at the start of the vaccination between older and younger animals; (2) at least 3 vaccinations are necessary to obtain antibody levels above the levels at pre-vaccination; (3) thereafter, annual vaccinations seem sufficient to keep antibody levels above the levels at pre-vaccination; and (4) both vaccines induced similar responses.

Previous research suggests some differences between male and female adolescents in correlates of vaccine receipt and reasons for non-vaccination; few studies examine both sexes together. This analysis assessed knowledge and attitudes related to HPV disease and vaccination, intention to vaccinate, and reasons for delayed vaccination or non-vaccination among parents of boys and girls 13-17\\xa0y old in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and selected local areas. METHODS: National Immunization Survey-Teen 2013 data were analyzed and gender differences examined. RESULTS: In this sample, adolescent boys were more likely than girls to be unvaccinated and less likely to have completed the HPV vaccination series (p < 0.005 for both). Parents of girls were more likely than parents of boys to report a provider recommendation for HPV vaccination (65.0% vs. 42.1%). Only 29% of girls' parents reported a provider recommendation to begin vaccination by 11-12\\xa0y old. Among unvaccinated teens, parental intention to vaccinate in the next 12 months did not differ by sex, but reasons for vaccination or non-vaccination did. Many parents do not know the recommended number of HPV doses. CONCLUSIONS: Gender differences in provider vaccination recommendations and reasons for vaccination might partially explain differential HPV uptake by male and female adolescents. Clinicians should offer strong recommendations for HPV vaccination at 11-12\\xa0y old for both girls and boys. To reduce missed opportunities, HPV vaccination should be presented in the context of, and given concurrently with, other routinely administered vaccines.\",\n",

We measured individuals' preferred location for seasonal flu vaccination by examining the National H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS) conducted from late 2009 to early 2010. Our econometric model estimated the probabilities of possible choices by varying individual characteristics, and predicted the way in which the probabilities are expected to change given the specific covariates of interest. From this estimation, we observed that non-traditional locations significantly influenced the vaccination of certain individuals, such as those who are high-income, educated, White, employed, and living in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA), by increasing the coverage. Thus, based on the empirical evidence, our study suggested that supporting non-traditional locations for vaccination could be effective in increasing vaccination coverage.\",\n",

       " 'Groups of 100 two-week-old cockerels were vaccinated with the A3 strain of IB vaccine by conjunctival, intranasal, in-contact, drinking water, or aerosol routes, or were left as unvaccinated controls. Three weeks after vaccination, each group of chickens was challenged with the Appin strain of IBV. Vaccination by the conjunctival, intranasal and in-contact routes induced a good resistance to challenge, concurring with an obvious stimulation of the Harderian gland, while the drinking water route led to a low resistance to challenge, with minor changes in the gland. The results of no immune response and no resistance to challenge in the birds vaccinated by aerosol route was due to unsuccessful vaccination in the group. Application of the vaccine by the conjunctival route would appear to be a most effective route for the application of Australian IB vaccines, while the in-contact method appears worthy of further study.',\n",

Our aim was, therefore, to create awareness about the importance of adult immunization. Although the true burden of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) among Indian adults is unknown, adults are particularly vulnerable during outbreaks, due to a lack of immunization, waning immunity, age-related factors (e.g. chronic conditions and immunosenescence), and epidemiological shift. There are no national adult immunization guidelines in India, and although several medical societies have published adult immunization guidelines, these vary, making it unclear who should receive which vaccines (based on age, underlying conditions, etc.). Other barriers to adult immunization include vaccine hesitancy, missed opportunities, and cost. Steps to improve adult vaccination could include: adoption of national guidelines, education of healthcare providers and the public, and promotion of life-course immunization.

The aim of the present study is to analyze the current vaccination practices within various population subgroups who are offered screening for hepatitis B, when found negative, in Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK. METHODS: Online surveys were conducted in the six countries. In total, 1181 experts from six different health professions were invited to participate. Descriptive analyses of data were performed. RESULTS: Less than half of the respondents in the Netherlands, only about 1/4 in Germany and none in Hungary reported that the vaccine is commonly offered to people who inject drugs. Less than half of the respondents in Germany reported vaccinating sex workers or HIV positive patients against hepatitis B as common practice. None in Hungary stated that vaccinating sex workers is common practice, and only according to a minority (17%) HIV patients are commonly vaccinated. 1/4 to 1/3 of respondents in Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Hungary and the UK, indicated that HCV positive patients are only sporadically immunized. Only in Spain almost half of the respondents reported that migrants from hepatitis B endemic areas who are screened negative are commonly vaccinated. Widespread uncertainty about vaccination practices for asylum seekers was reported. CONCLUSIONS: By showing the gaps between current practices and policies in place, our findings can help to increase the success of future vaccination programmes. Implementation of training for health care professional, e.g. introducing vaccinology and vaccination policy courses in the medical and paramedical curriculum, could contribute to a more homogenous application of the recommendations regarding immunization against hepatitis B. Our results show, nonetheless, that the universal vaccination approach, coupled with targeted programmes for immigrants, represents the only way to make the elimination of hepatitis B a foreseeable, realistic objective.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccination rates among children are low and novel strategies are needed to raise coverage. We measured the impact of school-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) on coverage, examined whether SLIV substitutes for practice-based influenza vaccination (\"substitution\"), and estimated whether a second year of experience with SLIV increases its impact. METHODS: We implemented a stepped wedge study design with schools as clusters. In Year 1, we randomly allocated schools to SLIV or control. In Year 2, all schools performed SLIV. We used emails (suburban schools) or backpack fliers (both urban and suburban schools) to notify parents, and offered web-based (suburban) or paper-based vaccination (urban) consent forms. Local health department nurses administered SLIV vaccinations and billed insurers. We analyzed state immunization registry data to measure influenza vaccination rates. RESULTS: 42 schools (38,078 children) participated over 2\\u202fyears. Overall vaccination rates were 5 and 7 percentage points higher among SLIV- school children versus control-school children in suburban (aOR 1.36, 95% CI 1.25-1.49 in Years 1-2 SLIV vs. Year 1 control schools) and urban schools (aOR 1.22, 95% CI 1.10-1.36), respectively, adjusting for prior year\\'s vaccination and other covariates. While no substitution occurred among children attending suburban schools, some substitution occurred among children attending urban schools, although overall vaccination rates were still higher in urban schools due to SLIV. Compared to an initial year of SLIV, more children were vaccinated in a second year of SLIV at urban (8.3% vs. 6.8%, aOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.47) but not suburban schools (3.5% vs. 2.7%, aOR 1.24, 95% CI 0.98-1.57). CONCLUSIONS: In this stepped wedge trial, SLIV increased overall influenza vaccination rates in suburban and urban schools. Some substitution for primary care vaccination occurred in urban settings. A second year of SLIV expanded its reach slightly in urban schools.',\n",
       " 'Adults also need to be vaccinated against infectious diseases. Standard vaccinations in adulthood include those against diphtheria, tetanus and polio -- but also catch-up vaccinations against measles, mumps and rubella are necessary. Special vaccinations are restricted to certain groups of persons. For the elderly, vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal infections are of particular importance.',\n",
       " 'In 1801 the smallpox vaccination has been introduced in Bavaria by order of the Duke Franz Joseph. He appointed a Medical Superintendent, responsible for smallpox vaccinations for the whole country. This was the hour of birth for the Institute, too. The Institute developed quickly to a point of crystallization in the field of prophylactic medicine, research on infectious diseases and social pediatrics. By this Institute the \"Retrovaccine\" against smallpox was introduced 1856. 1967 -- 1976 an attenuated life smallpox-vaccine (MVA) has been developed. Some years ago the activities of the Institute had been focussed into research of complications after vaccinations and up to date, on the pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis. A historical review demonstrates the development of the Institute in the past up to modern activities in research, teaching students and postgraduate education and in medical practice.',\n",
       " 'Vaccination has been one of the major revolutions in the history of human health. Vaccination programs have targeted entire populations such as infants or elderly subjects as a matter of being efficient with time and resources. These general populations are heterogeneous in terms of factors such as ethnicity, health status, and socio-economics. Thus, there have been variations in the safety and effectiveness profiles of certain vaccinations according to current population-wide strategies. As the concept of precision medicine has been raised in recent years, many researchers have suggested that vaccines could be administered more precisely in terms of particular target populations, vaccine formulations, regimens, and dosage levels. This review addresses the concept and framework of precision immunization, summarizes recent and representative clinical trials of among specific populations, mentions important factors to be addressed in customizing vaccinations, and provides suggestions on the establishment of precision immunization with the goal of maximizing the effectiveness of vaccines in general.',\n",
       " 'Since 2000, GAVI provided essential support for an unprecedented increase in the use of hepatitis B (HepB) and Haemophilus influenzae (Hib) containing vaccines in resource poor countries. This increase was supported with significant funding from international donors, intended to be time-limited. To assess the sustainability of this important expansion of the global access to vaccines, we reviewed supply chains, financial resources for procurement and decision-making in countries that introduced hepatitis B or Hib vaccines with GAVI support. During the period studied, the types of vaccine products supplied fluctuated rapidly in relationship with the number of suppliers and availability of more combination products. The price of the cheaper vaccines decreased while that of pentavalent DTwP-HepB-Hib remained stable. In average, vaccine introduction was associated with an increase of national programs budget, with new vaccines representing more than half of that increase, while the part of GAVI contributions to the budget went from 25% to 46%. Less than 20% of the vaccine introductions were decided by a national advisory body. Strengthening supply chains, adjusting funding schemes and increasing national ownership will be key to the sustained use of hepatitis B and Hib vaccines and the eventual addition of other important vaccines where they are the most needed.',\n",
       " 'Current evaluation models for the value of vaccines typically account for a small subset of the full social and economic benefits of vaccination. Health investments yield positive economic benefits via several channels at the household, community, and national levels. Underestimating, or worse, not considering these benefits can lead to ill-founded recommendations regarding the introduction of vaccines into immunization programs. The clear and strong links between health and wealth suggest the need to redesign valuation frameworks for vaccination so that the full costs may be properly weighed against the full benefits of vaccines.',\n",
       " \"Parental concerns have led to a recent decline in immunization coverage, resulting in outbreaks of diseases that were once under control in the US. As the CDC vaccination schedule continues to increase in complexity, the number of required injections per office visit increases as well. Some parents perceive that there is trauma associated with the administration of multiple injections, and research shows that having multiple vaccines due in a single visit is associated with delays and lower immunization rates. Combination vaccines make vaccination more efficient by incorporating the antigens of several different diseases into a single injection, but many parents worry that they may overload the child's developing immune system and leave him or her susceptible to secondary infections. This literature review synthesizes current evidence regarding the parental fear of vaccine-induced immune system overload and the fear of vaccine-associated trauma, in an attempt to understand the scope and nature of these fears. Despite the wealth of knowledge about each of these fears individually, it is still unknown which is of greater concern and how this affects parental decision-making.\",\n",

       " 'Complex humanitarian emergencies affect 40-60 million people annually and are a growing public health concern worldwide. Despite efforts to provide medical and public health services to populations affected by complex emergencies, significant morbidity and mortality persist. Measles is a major communicable disease threat, but through vaccination of broader target age groups beyond the traditional immunization schedule, measles-related mortality has been significantly reduced during crises. Yet, a limited number of vaccine-preventable diseases continue to contribute disproportionately to morbidity and mortality in complex emergencies. The literature suggests that Streptococcus pneumoniae, Rotavirus, and Haemophilus influenzae type-b should be key targets for vaccination programs. Because of the significant contribution of these three pathogens to complex humanitarian emergencies in low and middle-income countries regardless of disaster type, geography, or population, their vaccines should be considered essential components of the standard emergency response effort. We discuss the barriers to vaccine distribution and provide evidence for strategies to improve distribution, including expanded target age-range and reduced dose schedules. Our review includes specific recommendations for the expanded use of these three vaccines in complex emergencies in low and middle-income countries as a way to guide future policy discussions.',\n",

However, limited studies have investigated the willingness to get COVID-19 vaccines in populations. Therefore, the study aimed to determine the individual's willingness to accept and pay for COVID-19 vaccines, and knowledge, attitude, and perceptions (KAP) of COVID-19 vaccines, which hopefully will be available soon. Non-pregnant Chinese adults aged ≥18\\xa0years were asked to complete a self-administered KAP COVID-19 vaccine questionnaire distributed between March and May 2020. A total of 1179 participants (574 males and 605 females) were included and the mean age was 36.0\\xa0±\\xa011.5\\xa0years. Both the willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and pay for COVID-19 vaccines were high (77.4% and 81.1%), respectively. Also, the most acceptable price range of COVID-19 vaccine was ¥501-1000 (US $ 75-149). Education and willingness to be vaccinated were significantly associated with some of the responses in KAP (P <\\xa0.05). In conclusion, our study reported high willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and pay for COVID-19 vaccines in Chinese population. Our findings also provided some important contributions for public health policy makers to formulate appropriate vaccination programs.\",\n",

For subjects unvaccinated with influenza vaccine (past year), 1110/1115 (99.6%) had visited either a doctor (99.4%, mean 11.2 visits) or the same hospital (52.0%, mean 1.5 visits). For those unvaccinated with 23vPPV (past 5 years), 1809/1813 (99.8%) had visited either a doctor (99.7%, mean 11.2 visits) or the same hospital (51.5%, mean 1.5 times) in the past year; 71% had been admitted to the same hospital in the past 5 years (mean 3.4 times). 2.3% of all subjects had vaccination status recorded. No unvaccinated subject was vaccinated during admission, despite approximately 40% reporting acceptability of vaccination if offered. Previous hospitalisation was a risk factor for being unvaccinated. Barriers to implementation of current vaccination policy in the hospital setting require formal evaluation in Australia.',\n",
       " 'There is an ever-expanding technology that is aimed at making the administration of vaccines safer. Conventional ways of administering vaccines are being upgraded, modified or replaced by a wide variety of innovations. The paradigm of liquid vaccines, needles and syringes is slow to change, but already developments are occurring that will change for ever the way vaccines are administered and will improve the safety record of immunization. The oral route of vaccine administration has generally been thought of as safe, but until now only the polio vaccine has been widely used in this way. The conventional method of vaccine administration is by injection. Many ingenious devices have become available that now make injecting safer. Inventors are now looking imaginatively to alternative routes and technologies for delivering vaccines. Vaccines are generally manufactured to extremely high standards and rarely are shown to be the cause of safety issues. People remain the weakest safety link is vaccine administration. Technologies that bypasses the ability of man to make bad decisions or to behave incorrectly are of tremendous value. The vaccine world is in the middle of a radical re-think about how vaccines might best be administered. The presentation of the vaccine can be altered to fit new technologies such as powder jet guns, or skin patches. Even the conventional needle and syringe have evolved to much safer versions, and are set to continue this evolution. All this means even safer vaccines and their delivery.',\n",
       " 'Background: We aimed to evaluate whether the density of vaccination workers was associated with the immunization coverage in Zhejiang province.Methods: The immunization coverage of measles-containing vaccine (MCV), the third dose of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis combined vaccine (DTP3), and the third dose of poliomyelitis vaccine (PV3) was selected as the dependent variables. Immunization coverage data of children aged 13-23\\xa0months were taken from the Zhejiang immunization information system (ZJIIS). The aggregate density of vaccination workers was an independent variable in one set of regressions, while the full-time and part-time vaccination workers were adopted separately in other sets.Results: The density of total vaccination workers was positively and significantly associated with the immunization coverage (MCV: AOR\\xa0=\\xa03.36; DTP3: AOR\\xa0=\\xa02.68; PV3: AOR\\xa0=\\xa02.37). However, when the effects of full-time vaccination workers and part-time vaccination workers were assessed separately, we only found that the density of full-time vaccination workers was positively and significantly associated with the immunization coverage (MCV: AOR\\xa0=\\xa05.59; DTP3: AOR\\xa0=\\xa04.13; PV3: AOR\\xa0=\\xa03.28). The proportion of migrant children < 7\\xa0years and Land area were found as negative and significant factors for immunization coverage.Conclusions: A higher density of vaccination workers could improve the availability of vaccination services and immunization coverage. We recommended that government or other non-government organization should, apart from vaccine-related assistance, focus their efforts on human resources for vaccination.',\n",
       " 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the rationale of vaccines against cocaine and nicotine, to review progress in developing and trialing vaccines to treat dependence on these drugs and to discuss some of the ethical issues that may arise from their use in legally coerced addiction treatment or for prevention of addiction in adolescents. RECENT FINDINGS: Several randomized controlled trials of cocaine and nicotine vaccines for relapse prevention have produced mixed results. The studies demonstrate that it is possible to raise antibodies to cocaine and nicotine in humans. In abstinent patients who show high levels of drug antibodies, the rewarding effects of these drugs are attenuated. Phase 2 trials have not found nicotine vaccines to be superior to placebo because only a third of those vaccinated develop sufficient levels of antibody to block the effects of nicotine. SUMMARY: Vaccines are a novel approach to relapse prevention that need to more reliably induce immunity in a larger proportion of vaccinated patients if they are to protect against relapse after achieving abstinence. Vaccines are unlikely to prevent addiction in adolescents. Their use under legal coercion should only be considered after considerable experience with their use in voluntary patients.',\n",
       " \"Beginning in the 20th century with the consideration of the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the US, the cost effectiveness became a topic of discussion when this vaccine was being considered for universal use by the US Advisory Committee on Immunization practices (ACIP). In 2008, the ACIP began using formal criteria for the presentation of such data and their inclusion in ACIP discussions. More recently, the US Institute of Medicine has recommended that health economic considerations play a primary role in the prioritization of future vaccine for development. However, such analyses can be biased towards vaccines that provide economic benefit rather than those that reduce severe morbidity and mortality. This is because the economic impact of minor common events that result in medical utilization or time lost from work for parents can outweigh the economic impact of severe morbidity and mortality. Thus diseases with a low mortality and morbidity but with a common clinical manifestation such as the common cold could be prioritized over vaccines against diseases such as meningococcal sepsis where the morbidity and mortality associated with each case is very high, but there is no associated common clinical syndrome. Thus the use of cost effectiveness analyses as a 'gating criteria' to decide which vaccines should be developed or routinely used runs the risk of transforming vaccines into primarily a tool for achieving cost savings within the health care system rather than a public health intervention targeting human suffering, death and disability. It is the purpose of this article to review the framework under which health economic evaluations can be undertaken, to review the experience with and reliability of such analyses, and to discuss the potential negative implications of the use of health economic analyses as a primary decision making tool.\",\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Herd immunity, or community immunity, occurs when susceptible people in a population are indirectly protected from infection thanks to the pervasiveness of immunity within the population. In this study, we aimed to systematically review interventions designed to communicate what community immunity is and how community immunity works to members of the general public. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles describing interventions with or without evaluations. We then conducted web searches with Google to identify interventions lacking associated publications. We extracted data about the target population of the interventions, the interventions themselves (e.g., did they describe what community immunity is, and how it works), any effects of evaluated interventions, and synthesized data narratively. RESULTS: We identified 32 interventions: 11 interventions described in peer-reviewed articles and 21 interventions without associated articles. Of the 32 interventions, 5 described what community immunity is, 6 described the mechanisms of how community immunity occurs and 21 described both. Fourteen of the 32 addressed infectious diseases in general while the other 13 addressed one or more specific diseases. Twelve of the 32 interventions used videos, 7 used interactive simulations and 6 used questionnaires. Ten of the 11 peer-reviewed articles described studies evaluating at least one effect of the interventions. Within these 10, 4/4 reported increased knowledge, 3/5 reported shifts of attitudes in favour of vaccination, 2/5 reported increased intentions to vaccinate. Of 3 studies evaluating interventions specifically about community immunity, 2 reported increased intentions to vaccinate. CONCLUSIONS: A compelling benefit of vaccination exists at the population level in the form of community immunity. Identifying ways to optimally communicate about this benefit may be important, because some evidence suggests that effective communication about community immunity can increase vaccination intentions.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: In 2011, the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for male adolescents. METHODS: We used the 2013 National Immunization Survey-Teen data to assess HPV vaccine uptake (≥1 dose) and series completion (≥3 doses). Multivariable logistic regression analysis and a predictive marginal model were conducted to identify independent predictors of vaccination among adolescent males aged 13 to 17 years. RESULTS: HPV vaccination coverage with ≥1 dose was 34.6%, and series completion (≥3 doses) was 13.9%. Coverage was significantly higher among non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics compared with non-Hispanic white male adolescents. Multivariable logistic regression showed that characteristics independently associated with a higher likelihood of HPV vaccination (≥1 dose) included being non-Hispanic black race or Hispanic ethnicity; having mothers who were widowed, divorced, or separated; having 1 to 3 physician contacts in the past 12 months; a well-child visit at age 11 to 12 years; having 1 or 2 vaccination providers; living in urban or suburban areas; and receiving vaccinations from >1 type of facility (P < .05). Having mothers with some college or college education, having a higher family income to poverty ratio, living in the South or Midwest, and receiving vaccinations from all sexually transmitted diseases/school/teen clinics or other facilities were independently associated with a lower likelihood of HPV vaccination (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Following recommendations for routine HPV vaccination among male adolescents, uptake in 2013 was low in this population. Increased efforts are needed to improve vaccination coverage, especially for those who are least likely to be vaccinated.',\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: Maternal antibody levels after Tdap vaccination during pregnancy may affect infant primary antibody responses to pertussis, Tetanus toxoid (TT), Diphtheria toxoid (DT) vaccinations and pneumococcal vaccines with diphtheria toxin mutants like CRM197 as carrier protein. METHODS: Mothers were recruited in an open label randomised parallel controlled trial in 2014-2016 through midwifes. They received Tdap [Boostrix] at 30-32\\xa0weeks of pregnancy (n\\xa0=\\xa058) or within 48\\xa0h after delivery (n\\xa0=\\xa060). Infants received DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB [Infanrix Hexa] and 10-valent protein D conjugated pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV10 [Synflorix]) at age 3, 5 and 11\\xa0months. We now report on infant specific IgG levels towards DT, TT, Haemophilus influenzae type b polyribosylribitol phosphate (Hib PRP) and PHiD-CV10 before and after primary- and booster vaccination as secondary study endpoints; pertussis antibodies were the primary endpoint of the study. This trial is registered in clinicaltrialsregister.eu (EudraCT 2012-004006-9) and trialregister.nl (NTR number NTR4314). FINDINGS: Post primary vaccinations, antibody levels to DT, but not TT, were significantly lower after Tdap vaccination during pregnancy compared to controls (GMC ratio 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.6 and 0.9, 95% CI 0.6-1.2, respectively). Antibodies to serotype 19F were significantly lower in the maternal Tdap group, whereas there were no differences in antibody levels to Hib PRP and the other 9 pneumococcal serotypes. Post booster vaccinations, no significant differences were observed, except for DT. INTERPRETATION: Maternal Tdap vaccination results in significant interference with infants responses not only to DT but also to conjugated pneumococcal vaccines containing DT mutants as carrier proteins. These interactions after maternal Tdap vaccination need to be taken into account when designing infants' national immunization schedules and choice of vaccines.

       " \"Aims: Delay of childhood vaccinations is common and influences efforts to reduce targeted diseases. In Denmark, the diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTaP-IPV-Hib) vaccine is recommended at ages 3, 5 and 12 months and the first measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR-1) at 15 months. Following guidelines, children delayed at age 15 months should receive MMR-1 and DTaP-IPV-Hib-3 simultaneously, unless DTaP-IPV-Hib-2 was received less than 6 months ago, when MMR-1 alone is recommended. We studied compliance with these guidelines and the reasons for non-compliance with a focus on vaccination providers. Methods: We used a nationwide register-based cohort study of children born in Denmark between January 2000 and June 2013, who were lacking MMR-1 and DTaP-IPV-Hib-3 at age 15 months and were followed to 24 months. We also performed semi-structured telephone interviews with vaccination providers. Results: The study consisted of 156,921 children (18% of the children born in the period). Among the 40,060 children who had received DTaP-IPV-Hib-2 less than 6 months ago, 37,892 (95%) received MMR-1 alone. Among the 88,469 children who had received DTaP-IPV-Hib-2 more than 6 months ago, 6334 (7%) received DTaP-IPV-Hib-3 and MMR-1 simultaneously. The interviews indicated that some vaccination providers are reluctant to give multiple vaccinations at the same visit and some have a preference of following the usual sequence in the programme. Conclusions: Vaccination providers generally complied with the recommended minimum 6 months' interval between DTaP-IPV-Hib-2 and DTaP-IPV-Hib-3. Conversely, there was a low compliance with the recommendation to administer DTaP-IPV-Hib-3 and MMR-1 simultaneously. More efforts are needed to ensure timely vaccination.\",\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Migrants may be underimmunised and at higher risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, yet there has been no comprehensive examination of what policies are currently implemented across Europe targeting child and adult migrants. We analysed vaccination policies for migrants in 32 EU/EEA countries and Switzerland. METHODS: Using framework analysis, we did a comparative analysis of national policies and guidelines pertaining to vaccination in recently arrived migrants through a systematic guideline and literature review and by approaching national experts. RESULTS: Six (18.8%) of 32 countries had comprehensive policies specific to the vaccination of migrants (two focused only on child migrants, four on both adults and children). Nineteen (59.4%) countries applied their national vaccination schedule for migrant vaccinations, predominantly focusing on children; and five (15.6%) countries had circulated additional migrant-specific resources to relevant health-care providers. In six (18.8%) countries, policies on migrant vaccination focused on outbreak-specific vaccines only. In ten (31.3%) countries, policies focused on priority vaccinations, with polio being the vaccine most commonly administered and heterogeneity noted in vaccines recommended to adults, adolescents, and children. Eighteen (56.3%) countries recommended that an individual should be considered as unvaccinated where vaccination records were missing, and vaccines re-administered. Nine (28.1%) countries reported that specific vaccinations were mandatory. CONCLUSION: There is considerable variation in policies across Europe regarding approaches to vaccination in adult and child migrants, and a lack of clarity on optimum ways forward, what vaccines to offer, with a need for robust research in this area. More emphasis must be placed on ensuring migrant-specific guidance is disseminated to front-line healthcare professionals to improve vaccine delivery and uptake in diverse migration populations across the region.',\n",

Costs related to vaccination, side effects, and gastroenteritis were identified. Children received RRV-TV (n = 1,191) or placebo (n = 1,207) at 2, 3, and 5 months of age with other infant vaccinations. Prospective follow-up averaged 1.0 years per child. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed from the perspective of society. Nine cases of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis occurred in the RRV-TV group, versus 100 in the placebo group (P < .0001); mean cost per vaccinated child was 4 Finnish marks (FIM) in the RRV-TV group, versus 203 FIM in the placebo group. Side effects with related costs occurred after 11% and 7% of doses in the RRV-TV group and placebo group, respectively (P < .001); mean cost per child was 89 FIM vs. 75 FIM. The break-even cost (i.e., net benefit, excluding cost of vaccine) of RRV-TV in prevention of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis was 109 FIM (U.S. $19.60) per child.',\n",

To rapidly identify recent changes, we have explored the feasibility and relevance of using vaccine reimbursement data. METHODS: We used the Permanent Sample of Beneficiaries, a representative sample of the National Health Insurance Information System, which contains data on health spending reimbursement of the vast majority of the population. We first validated this new source by comparing measles vaccine coverage between Child Health Certificates and the Permanent Sample of Beneficiaries. We present herein the results on hepatitis B, meningococcal C, and human papillomavirus vaccination (HPV) coverage. RESULTS: Measles vaccine coverage estimated with the Permanent Sample of Beneficiaries (91.4%) is very close to the estimation obtained through Child Health Certificates (90.6%). For children born in 2011, hepatitis B vaccination coverage at 24 months of age was 88.7% for one dose and meningococcal vaccination coverage was 56.4% for one dose in December 2013. Of girls born in 1997, 20.1% had received the full HPV vaccination series on their 16th birthday.

       " 'The objective of the study was to assess varicella epidemiology and the cost of disease in Spain, in order to perform a cost benefit analysis of universal vaccination at 15 months of age. Epidemiological data were obtained from a survey of 150 children with varicella, from hospitalizations and from the Spanish literature. A Markov decision tree was designed with two alternatives, vaccination or nonvaccination. Direct costs derived from the disease were lower than the cost of vaccination (ratio 0.54:1), however when indirect costs, such as working time loss were taken into account, vaccination was the best alternative, with a saving of P(T)2627 per vaccinated subject (P(T)1.6 recovered per peseta invested in the program). Sensitivity analysis shows that decreasing vaccine coverage and efficacy to 0.7, increasing the annual discount rate to 20% and with a vaccine price less than P(T)6000, vaccination is always the best alternative. In conclusion, from the economic point of view, a universal varicella vaccination program in children at 15 months of age would be justified in Spain.',\n",
       " \"The State of Connecticut mandates that prekindergarten children be vaccinated against the influenza virus each year by December 31st. Annually, prekindergarten students in urban schools in Connecticut are not compliant with this statute due to many factors such as parents' lack of education. The purpose of an educational intervention project (EIP) is to provide urban prekindergarten parents/caregivers with education about the influenza virus, influenza vaccine, the community resources, and Connecticut mandates. An influenza vaccine educational intervention was provided to parents and caregivers of prekindergarten students in one urban elementary school in Connecticut. Parents were educated during an open house at the school and then 4 weeks later at a Meet and Greet with prekindergarten parents. Information regarding influenza virus, vaccine, and state regulations was provided along with Pre- and post-questionnaires to assess the level of knowledge. The goal of this EIP is increased knowledge of the influenza virus, the vaccine, community resources, and state regulations. The success of this educational intervention can be shared and implemented in other licensed prekindergarten programs to increase parents' knowledge and it would lead to increased rates of district-wide compliance and decreased student absences. Most importantly, implications point to the potential protection of the public from an illness stemming from the influenza virus.\",\n",
       " \"The burden of infectious diseases preventable by vaccination decreased considerably over last decades in all countries provided with effective immunization schedules. Implementation of these programs with new vaccines has started discussion on duality between mandatory and recommended vaccinations. Regional autonomy has allowed the Veneto Region, with introduction of Law 7/2007, to experience suspension of all mandatory childhood vaccinations, replaced by an active and free offer of all vaccines recognized as safe and effective. Coverage's trends and acceptance of invitation are carefully monitored to avoid loss of compliance and reduction of immunized children. The evaluation, performed on population of Rovigo ULSS18 for 2002-2008 birth cohorts (2008 is the first concerned by the change), revealed no fall for previously mandatory vaccinations, but rather a slight increase. Percentage of non-vaccinated children was negligible. The leading cause of non-vaccination to polio was inability to deliver the letter of invitation due to wrong address. An informed dissent was expressed only by a minority (0.9% in 2008 birth cohort). Compliance to immunization offer was elevated both for previously compulsory and recommended vaccinations. Experience of Rovigo ULSS 18 showed that, in a context of already high levels of coverage for recommended vaccinations with optimal organization of immunization services, coverage rates for ex-mandatory vaccines remain unchanged. Further research and reports are required to carefully assess the effect on coverage rates in next birth cohorts, but available data are encouraging. Similar legislative measures can be successfully adopted by other Regions with starting conditions comparable to Veneto Region.\",\n",
       " 'The assessment and management of biological risk has always been a primary goal toward which occupational medicine has focused its efforts, in particular in healthcare workplaces. Healthcare professionals represent a category of workers at high risk for infections, many of which are vaccine-preventable diseases. There are various reasons for vaccinating healthcare workers, including to prevent illness among them so as to reduce absenteeism, to ensure an effective health service to users and to reduce social costs. Recently, the issue of vaccinations has been the subject of many debates. Vaccination is not always appreciated by health operators, and the reasons for low vaccination coverage are several and heterogeneous. This paper focuses on current Italian law and vaccination policies, along with the international background, evaluating the effectiveness of current policies and the consequences on public health. Overall, preventing infectious diseases means reducing costs, cases and outbreaks, shows responsibility toward third parties, and improves general welfare.',\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: Administration of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine decreased dramatically in Japan after extensive news of adverse vaccine events and suspension of the governmental recommendation for the vaccine. In this study, we investigated the knowledge and acceptance of vaccinated adolescents concerning cervical cancer, cancer screening and the HPV vaccine. Furthermore, we analyzed whether and by how much the news affected acceptance of the vaccination. METHODS: This study was conducted as a part of Osaka Clinical resEArch of HPV vacciNe (OCEAN) study. A questionnaire was distributed to 2,777 study registrants. RESULTS: The response rate was 38%. The recognition rate of the news of the vaccine's adverse events was 80%; it was 68% for awareness of the government's announcement of the suspension of its recommendation for the vaccine. Among those who had a chance to hear or see the negative news during their vaccination period, 46 (60%) continued vaccination while knowing of the news, 22 (29%) discontinued vaccination, and 9 (11%) continued vaccination without an awareness of the news. Reports of the vaccine's adverse events were the main reason for not continuing the vaccination series. Those who consulted doctors after hearing the adverse news were significantly more likely to continue their vaccinations than those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Our results should help in understanding the need for a strong promotion of vaccine usage and cancer screening after future retraction of the recommendation suspension. This may apply to other countries with an unsatisfactory rate of HPV vaccination due to fears of adverse vaccine events.\",\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: In France, many parents have lost confidence in vaccinations, which has a direct impact on immunization coverage. Pharmacists, like other health professionals, often encounter parents exhibiting vaccine distrust. METHODS: Using a survey distributed in a school and in a number of volunteering pharmacies, the objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of the views and the attitude of parents in regard to vaccination of their children. RESULTS: Our results show that the main concerns were in regard to vaccine adjuvants, the risk of short- and long-term adverse effects, and the risk of developing a disease or a disability as a result of vaccination. The parents, although they tended to express a degree of reluctance and apprehension, in general, they were not opposed to vaccination, and they sought objective scientific information and full transparency regarding all aspects of vaccine composition, adverse effects, and effectiveness. Cooperation of all the parties involved in the health system on this subject is essential for a seamless chain of care and to improve vaccination coverage. CONCLUSION: The information collected, combined with a review of the international literature, allow avenues for dialogue adapted to parents' opinions to be established and thus assist health professionals to communicate effectively regarding vaccines, which is a bona fide public health issue.\",\n",
       " 'The vaccines which are now at our disposal have been largely perfected, are constantly examined and have proved most successful. It is owing to their use that epidemics have been eradicated and tremendous suffering has been relieved. It is a matter of course that all vaccination recommendations are to be constantly monitored and also revised in case new situations come about; however, it would be foolish not to make use of this excellent possibility offered by prophylactic medicine.',\n",
       " 'Liquid spray and aerosol mass vaccination of poultry have several drawbacks, such as uncontrolled deposition of vaccine particles in the respiratory tract and vaccine virus inactivation by formation and evaporation of droplets. These may be addressed by using dry powder vaccines with defined particle size distribution targeting the upper (primary vaccination) or the entire respiratory tract (booster vaccination). Therefore, a coarse Newcastle disease (LZ58 strain) powder vaccine was administered to specified pathogen free (SPF) broiler hens to compare the antibody response and adverse vaccinal reactions with those induced by a coarse liquid spray and a fine liquid aerosol. Groups of 40 broilers each housed in isolators were vaccinated at 4 days of age and intratracheally inoculated with Escherichia coli (strain 506) at 11 days of age. Adverse vaccinal reactions were evaluated by measuring body weight gain and mortality between 4 and 11 days of age and between 11 and 18 days of age, and by recording colibacillosis lesions at 18 days of age. The antibody serum response was measured at 18 days of age by the haemagglutination inhibition test. Despite the relative low initial vaccine virus loss and narrow particle size distribution of the powder vaccines in comparison with their liquid counter parts, no significant differences (P > 0.05) regarding adverse vaccinal reactions and antibody response were observed between broilers vaccinated with the powder vaccines or with their liquid counterparts.',\n",
       " \"This article is an overview and assessment of available veterinary vaccines, placed in a historical context. A more complete presentation of the main tenets of the symposium talk at Agenda for Action: Veterinary Medicine's Role in Biodefense and Public Health is published elsewhere.' The symposium presentation contained a critical evaluation of the current state of the field of veterinary vaccines for both food and companion animals and of promises for future vaccine development. There is considerable variability in safety and sustained efficacy among veterinary vaccines, especially those developed for companion animals. Standardization of vaccines and vaccinal strains and detailed knowledge of their safety, efficacy, and potency and of the duration of immunity are needed before rational recommendations can truly be made. It is proposed that the establishment of an international vaccine advisory committee be supported, which would function to apprise the veterinary profession of the current status of vaccines and their use, and that a system for reporting vaccine adverse events, similar to that for humans, should be established.\",\n",
       " \"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the vaccination status of children with a chronic disease in adequate, what amount of delay occurs and whether vaccination opportunities are missed. DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive. SETTING: Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital, Groningen, the Netherlands. METHODS: Vaccination data of all 79 children with chronic diseases admitted to the infant and toddler ward of the Beatrix Children's Hospital between January 1 and December 31 1993 were obtained through review of hospital admission charts and local Vaccination Administration records, as well as through telephone contacts with the parents. The data of 71 children were complete; these were compared with the vaccination guidelines with respect to diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-poliomyelitis (DTPP) vaccination and mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccination. RESULTS: Vaccination coverage for DTPP reached over 90% although for DTPP 3 and 4 with a delay of more than 3 months. MMR vaccination coverage was 86%. Only 21% of the patients received all vaccinations within a period of 1 month after the recommended age. Among the remaining 79% of children 56 opportunities were missed to administer vaccines during admission. Twenty-one times the possibility to administer DTPP and MMR simultaneously was missed. CONCLUSION: Children with a chronic disease run a high risk of incomplete and delayed immunization.\",\n",
       " 'Introduction: This review analyzes the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccinations in lung transplant patients before and after transplantation.Areas covered: This review addresses the risk for respiratory infections, in particular pneumococcal infections, in lung transplantation patients in the context of immunodeficiency and immunosuppressive medication. Vaccination is recommended to counteract the increased risk of pneumococcal infection, and the relevant guidelines are discussed in this review. The design of specific vaccination schedules is required because of the impaired antibody response in specific patient categories.Expert opinion: Lung transplantation candidates should be vaccinated with pneumococcal vaccines prior to transplantation. Currently, the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine offers the broadest coverage, but the antibody response should be monitored. New generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccines with equally broad serotype coverage could be used in the future. During the post-transplantation period, the immune status of the patients should be monitored regularly, and vaccination should be repeated when indicated.',\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND: Approximately 70,000 refugees are resettled to the United States each year. Providing vaccination to arriving refugees is important to both reduce the health-related barriers to successful resettlement, and protect the health of communities where refugees resettle. It is crucial to understand the process and resources expended at the state/local and federal government levels to provide vaccinations to refugees resettling to the United States. OBJECTIVES: We estimated costs associated with delivering vaccines to refugees at the Board of Health Refugee Services, DeKalb county, Georgia (DeKalb clinic). METHODS: Vaccination costs were estimated from two perspectives: the federal government and the DeKalb clinic. Data were collected at the DeKalb clinic regarding resources used for vaccination: staff numbers and roles; type and number of vaccine doses administered; and number of patients. Clinic costs included labor and facility-related overhead. The federal government incurred costs for vaccine purchases and reimbursements for vaccine administration. RESULTS: The DeKalb clinic average cost to administer the first dose of vaccine was $12.70, which is lower than Georgia Medicaid reimbursement ($14.81), but higher than the State of Georgia Refugee Health Program reimbursement ($8.00). Federal government incurred per-dose costs for vaccine products and administrative reimbursement were $42.45 (adults) and $46.74 (children). CONCLUSIONS: The total costs to the DeKalb clinic for administering vaccines to refugees are covered, but with little surplus. Because the DeKalb clinic 'breaks even,' it is likely they will continue to vaccinate refugees as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\",\n",

       " \"In 1986 the Ottawa Charter underlined the importance of advocacy in health. This article analyzes the role of advocacy in Public Health making the case of immunization, whose coverage rates are decreasing in many countries. An effective advocacy action could counteract the growing phenomenon of the vaccine hesitancy within both the general population and an increasing share of healthcare providers as well as contrast antivax movements' action. We identify who are the advocates focusing on Italy and on the crucial role of scientific societies which share the responsibility of making the latest scientific evidence and most effective infectious diseases' control strategies available to health policy makers. The Italian Society of Hygiene (SItI) has been actively engaged for several years in a number of initiatives of advocacy communication and vaccines including research, training, media exposure and a dedicated website portal (vaccinarSì).\",\n",
       " \"CONTEXT: Concerns about financial barriers to vaccination led to the development of the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, which provides free vaccines to states for children who are uninsured, Medicaid eligible, or Native American or Native Alaskan. OBJECTIVE: To understand the effect of economic factors on physician likelihood of referring children to public vaccine clinics for immunizations and to evaluate the VFC program. DESIGN: A standardized survey was conducted in 1995 by trained personnel using computer-assisted telephone interviewing. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A stratified random sample of family physicians, pediatricians, and general practitioners younger than 65 years who were in office-based practices across the United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Likelihood of referral of a child to a health department for vaccination by child's insurance status and by the physician's receipt of free vaccines. RESULTS: Of the 1769 physicians with whom an interviewer spoke, 1236 participated. Most respondents (66%) were likely to refer an uninsured child to the health department for vaccination, whereas only 8% were likely to refer a child who had insurance that covers vaccination. The majority (58%) of physicians reported differential referral based on insurance status. Among physicians who received free vaccine supplies from the VFC program or elsewhere, 44% were likely to refer an uninsured child whereas 90% of those not receiving free vaccine were likely to refer the same child (P<.001). In regression analysis, the receipt of free vaccine supplies accounted for 24% of the variance in the likelihood to refer an uninsured child for vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians receiving free vaccine supplies report being less likely to refer children to public clinics for vaccinations.\",\n",
       " 'Tobacco smoking is globally far more widespread than use of any other substance of abuse. Nicotine is an important tobacco constituent that is responsible for addictive properties of smoking. The currently available medications for the treatment of nicotine addiction have limited efficacy. A challenging novel therapeutic concept is vaccination against nicotine. An efficient vaccine would generate antibodies that sequester nicotine in the blood and prevent its access to the brain. The vaccine would have great potential for treating nicotine addiction and for relapse prevention. We reviewed the current status of vaccines against nicotine addiction that are undergoing clinical trials or are in preclinical development. We discuss problems associated with the development of nicotine vaccines, their efficacy in addiction treatment, challenges and ethical concerns. Existing evidence indicates that nicotine vaccination is well tolerated and capable of inducing an immune response but its effectiveness in increasing smoking abstinence has not been shown so far.',\n",

       " \"BACKGROUND: Guizhou Province of China implements a vaccination program specifying that children's vaccination records are to be checked upon entry to kindergarten and primary school; children missing one or more recommended vaccinations are to be offered the missed vaccinations; school-level vaccination coverage levels are assessed at the time of school enrollment and six months later to monitor compliance rates. METHODS: We obtained the number of doses of each vaccine in the national immunization schedule that were administered before and six months after kindergarten and school enrollment and reported to Guizhou Province during 2004 through 2018. We determined temporal trends in coverage of the second dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) and other vaccines, incidence of measles, and number of school-based measles outbreaks. RESULTS: MCV2 coverage at kindergarten entry increased from 53% in 2004 to 98% in 2018. Among children missing one or more vaccinations, the six-month catch-up rate of MCV2 increased from 80% in 2004 to 99% in 2018. Among primary school children, coverage of MCV2 and other recommended vaccines had similar increases. The annual incidence of measles among Guizhou's total population declined from 280 per million in 2003 to 0.3 per million in 2018. There have been no measles outbreaks in kindergartens or schools since 2015. CONCLUSIONS: Checking vaccination record at kindergartens and primary schools and providing necessary catch-up vaccination was associated with increased coverage of measles and other vaccines, lower incidence of measles, and an apparent end to school-based measles outbreaks. Guizhou's experience of checking vaccination records at school enrollment led to implementation of this strategy in other provinces. In 2019, the kindergarten and school entry vaccination record check program was incorporated into China's national vaccine law.\",\n",
       " 'South Africa provides a useful country case study for financing vaccinations. It has been an early adopter of new vaccinations and has financed these almost exclusively from domestic resources, largely through general taxation. National vaccination policy is determined by the Department of Health, based on advice from a national advisory group on immunisation. Standard health economic criteria of effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, affordability and burden of disease are used to assess whether new vaccinations should be introduced. Global guidelines and the advice of local and international experts are also helpful in making the determination to introduce new vaccines. In terms of recent decisions to introduce new vaccines against pneumococcal disease and rotavirus diarrhoea in children, the evidence has proved unequivocal. Universal rollout has been implemented even though this has led to a fivefold increase in national spending on vaccines. The total cost to government remains below 1-1.5% of public expenditures for health, which is viewed by the South African authorities as affordable and necessary given the number of lives saved and morbidity averted. To manage the rapid increase in domestic spending, efforts have been made to scale up coverage over several years, give greater attention to negotiating price reductions and, in some cases, obtain initial donations or frontloaded deliveries to facilitate earlier universal rollout. There has been strong support from a wide range of stakeholders for the early introduction of new generation vaccines.',\n",
       " \"Health literacy skills are cognitive and social skills which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand, and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health'. Patients use these literacy skills to critically analyze information; to allow them to exert greater control over life events and situations. An understanding of health literacy is also important for those developing and delivering healthcare programmes, especially vaccination programmes, as both the information and the actions required to use the information are complex requiring sophisticated health literacy skills beyond the capacity of a significant proportion of the population. There are simple steps which can be taken to make the information in vaccination materials easier to understand and use. The complex concepts of reading and numeracy skills in relation to health will be discussed and strategies described which can improve access to healthcare information for all patients, whatever their literacy level.\",\n",

       " 'OBJECTIVE: To measure the uptake of preadolescent measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and adolescent hepatitis B vaccinations and assess the influence of certain demographic factors on the uptake of these vaccines. DESIGN: Prevalence surveys of uptake rates of preadolescent (school Year 6; age 10-11 years) MMR and adolescent (school Year 9; age 13-14 years) hepatitis B vaccination. SETTING: City of Darebin, an inner northern metropolitan region of Melbourne, 1996. SUBJECTS: 1160 Year 6 school students (580 boys) and 1102 Year 9 school students (548 boys). INTERVENTION: School-based vaccination program administered by Darebin Council. RESULTS: 83% of Year 6 students were vaccinated with the MMR vaccine (84.1% of girls and 81.9% of boys). 71.6% of Year 9 students completed the full course of hepatitis B vaccination (68.9% of boys and 74.2% of girls). There was a higher uptake of MMR in non-government primary schools, but no other demographic factors (sex, economic status, non-English-speaking background, parental education, school class size) were associated. CONCLUSIONS: These uptake rates do not meet National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) recommendations. Further study is required to determine and quantify the factors that affect vaccination uptake in adolescence. Programs may then be developed to improve vaccination uptake.',\n",

       " \"OBJECTIVES: To assess vaccination status in a cohort of children with rheumatic diseases followed at the University Children's Hospital Ljubljana and to evaluate the most common reasons for vaccination dropout. METHODS: Patients with rheumatic diseases who were evaluated at the rheumatology outpatient clinic between January 2015 and January 2017 received a questionnaire about their vaccination status and reasons for potential vaccination dropout. Vaccination coverage for individual vaccines was determined at 5, 10, 18 years and at the time of their last clinic visit. RESULTS: Data were received from 187 out of 424 enrolled patients (44.1%). Majority of included patients had juvenile idiopathic arthritis (n=165), followed by childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (n=6), juvenile dermatomyositis (n=5), mixed connective tissue disease (n=3), chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, juvenile systemic sclerosis, Takayasu's arteritis (n=2 each), granulomatous polyangiitis and fibromyalgia (n=1 each). Vaccination coverage was complete in 91.9%, 70.3%, 66.7% and 64.7% of patients at 5, 10, 18 years and at their last clinic visit, respectively. Most commonly omitted vaccines were hepatitis B and second dose of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Most common additional vaccine was against rotavirus. Most common reason for vaccination dropout was suggestion of the treating rheumatologist. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-five percent of our patients remain incompletely vaccinated and thus susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases. Physicians play a crucial role in the decision to vaccinate.\",\n",

       "\"Assessing the operational costs of routine immunization activities at the sub-center level in Myanmar: What matters for increasing national immunization coverage?BACKGROUND: Myanmar's national immunization program was launched in 1978. Routine immunization is mainly provided at sub-center level with midwives assigned as main vaccinators. The vaccinators at the sub-centers have to obtain vaccines from their designated township health department's cold room for immunization services. This study aimed to calculate the operational costs of routine immunization at sub-centers in Myanmar. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 160 sub-centers throughout the country. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with the main vaccinator at each sub-center using a pre-tested questionnaire. The study analyzed the operational costs per facility and the associations between sub-center characteristics and operational costs. RESULTS: In Myanmar, the average operational costs of routine immunization per sub-center ranged from 434,700-990,125 MMK for rural areas and 235,875-674,250 MMK for urban areas. The operational costs increased by 8,749.50 MMK (95% CI: 6,805.79-10,693.21; p\\u202f<\\u202f0.001) per mile and 5,752.50 MMK (95% CI: 914.22-10,590.79; p\\u202f<\\u202f0.05) per working day. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that the operational costs at sub-centers were high and varied significantly among the different geographical areas. The operational costs could be reduced by additional support for the resources, for example, installing cold chain facilities at sub-centers and opening new sub-centers throughout the country.\""
